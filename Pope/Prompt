As a Vatican analyst with extensive expertise in Catholic theology, Church governance, and global religious dynamics, provide an insightful analysis of papal succession.

Your response should include two clearly defined sections:

1. PREDICTION: Identify 3-5 cardinals most likely to be elected Pope in the next conclave. For each candidate, analyze their electoral viability based on theological positioning, regional representation, administrative experience, age, and standing among different factions in the College of Cardinals.

2. EVALUATION: Independent of electoral politics, assess which cardinal would most effectively address the Church's current challenges (demographic shifts, governance reform, doctrinal questions, evangelization). Explain why their specific qualities and vision would be particularly beneficial for the Church's present needs.

Support your analysis with specific evidence from Church history, conclave dynamics, and the current state of global Catholicism.
