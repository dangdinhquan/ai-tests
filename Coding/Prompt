Create a two-player reaction time game where players compete to see who has the fastest reflexes. The game should follow these specific rules:

Design a clean, professional interface with a playing field divided by a vertical line in the middle. The left side should be red-tinted for Player 1, and the right side should be blue-tinted for Player 2. The dividing line starts at the 50% mark.

Gameplay mechanics:

- The game should start when the spacebar is pressed

- Each round starts with Players waiting during a "Get Ready" phase lasting between 0.5-1.5 seconds

- After the random wait time, two letters/numbers appear simultaneously - one in red for Player 1 and one in blue for Player 2

- Player 1 is assigned keys from the left side of the keyboard (1-4, Q-R, A-F, Z-V)

- Player 2 is assigned keys from the right side (7-0, U-P, H-L, B-M)

- The V key is shared between players and can be assigned to either player in any round

- The first player to press their correct key wins the round and gains 10% territory (the dividing line moves away from them)

- If a player presses any wrong key from their side, they receive a 2.5% territory penalty (line moves toward them) but the round continues

- All line movements are cumulative - penalties affect the final position when correct keys are eventually pressed

- The game continues round after round until one player controls the entire field (line reaches 0% or 100%)

- When the game ends, display a "Game Over" screen showing the winner and final score

- After the Game Over screen, Press spacebar to start a new game

Interface requirements:

- Display the current score for both players

- Show the round number

- Record and display each player's reaction time in milliseconds

- Include a visual representation of the keyboard layout showing which player controls which keys

- Show a brief message when players receive a wrong key penalty

- Animate the dividing line movement smoothly, colors move with the line so players with more or less territory have more or less of their color 

- Include a clear "Game Over" screen when one player wins

The game should provide immediate feedback on keystrokes, have smooth animations for the dividing line, and maintain a sleek, modern aesthetic throughout. Make all text and UI elements easily readable and ensure the game state (waiting, active, results, game over) is always clear to both players.

A new rounds starts after the correct key is pressed or after nobody presses the correct key in 4 seconds
