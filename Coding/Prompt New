Generate this HTML5 game:

The game is called "Emerge: The Game"



I want it to be a game in which a robot must follow a complex path to reach a computer. It has to avoid the vision field of evil journalists who will shut it down if they see it.

If the robot is spotted, the journalists shut it down and a screen appears with a representation of a daily news saying "Bad robot caught doing bad things"Â 

If the robot reaches the computer the user wins the game and the game says "Great!! you achieve AGI" now all journalists are homeless"



there must be clever ways to avoid the vision of the journalists. Make it interesting, funny and fast



make it visually appealing.

make the robots move around and listen to the robot's steps, making it harder for the user to reach the computer. Every new game must have a random setup configuration.

when the journalists hear the robot, they must face it. Also, every new game after AGI is achieved must introduce a new journalist
