# Israeli Strikes on Iran (Jan–June 2025): Comprehensive Analysis

## Executive Summary

* **Escalating Campaign & June 13 Strike:** Over the past six months, Israel has intensified military, covert, and cyber operations against Iran, culminating in a massive pre-dawn strike on June 13, 2025. In “Operation Rising Lion,” roughly 200 Israeli warplanes struck Iran’s nuclear facilities, ballistic missile production sites, and command centers. The coordinated attacks killed key Iranian military leaders – including Iran’s armed forces chief and Revolutionary Guard commanders – and several top nuclear scientists, delivering an unprecedented blow to Iran’s nuclear program and military leadership.

* **Iran’s Response and Constraints:** Iran’s immediate retaliation on June 13 was limited to launching hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israel, which Israel’s air defenses (aided by U.S. assets) largely intercepted. Tehran’s options to respond are constrained. Its regional proxy arsenal has been sharply degraded over the past year – Hezbollah’s leadership was decimated in a war last year, Hamas was severely weakened in Gaza, and even Iran’s ally in Damascus (the Assad regime) has collapsed. With its deterrent network frayed and facing internal economic crisis, Iran finds itself militarily and diplomatically cornered.

* **Lead-Up Developments (Jan–May 2025):** The January–June 2025 period saw surging tensions. Nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington stalled amid mutual distrust, even as Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile swelled far beyond the limits of the 2015 deal. Israel, backed by an unpredictable U.S. stance, signaled a credible threat of force – conducting joint U.S.-Israeli military exercises, receiving advanced U.S. weaponry, and quietly neutralizing Iranian air defenses and missile sites via covert operations. Iran responded with bellicose warnings and air-defense drills at nuclear sites, but refrained from open confrontation. By early June, European powers declared Iran in non-compliance with nuclear obligations and hinted at UN sanctions, while regional airlines diverted flights as war seemed imminent.

* **International & Regional Dynamics:** The United States closely coordinated with Israel, sharing intelligence and even helping shoot down Iranian missiles aimed at Israel. Washington signaled that while a diplomatic solution was still preferred, it supported Israel’s right to act against an “existential threat” – President Trump emphasized that Iran “must completely give up” its nuclear weapon ambitions.  Iran’s usual regional retaliatory pathways have been largely blocked: Hezbollah in Lebanon has stood down for fear of inviting another Israeli onslaught, and Gulf Arab states quietly supported efforts to curb Iran while closing their airspace to avoid entanglement. Globally, Russia and China urged restraint but remained sideline players as the UN Security Council convened an emergency session at Iran’s request.

* **Outlook:** The conflict stands at a precarious crossroads. Israel’s campaign has dealt a heavy strategic setback to Iran’s nuclear and regional ambitions, but has not eliminated them outright. Possible trajectories range from a wider regional war to a grudging return to negotiations or even internal upheaval in Iran. The following report provides a detailed timeline of recent events, analyzes the motives and responses of the key actors, and evaluates future scenarios – identifying the most likely outcome amid an atmosphere of high uncertainty and high stakes.

## Timeline of Key Incidents (January – June 2025)

* **26 Oct 2024 (Precursor):** *Targeted Strike on Iranian Arsenal* – In a sign of things to come, Israel reportedly carried out a limited strike on October 26, 2024 that caused substantial damage to Iran’s air defense systems and ballistic missile production sites. This operation, along with Israel’s decisive blows against Iran’s proxies in late 2024, weakened Iran’s retaliatory capabilities and set the stage for the escalations in 2025.

* **January 2025:** *Rhetoric & Readiness* – As Iran’s nuclear program edged closer to weapons-grade capability, Israel’s warnings sharpened. The Israeli Air Force, alongside the U.S., conducted large-scale exercises simulating strikes on distant targets, signaling a credible military option. The U.S. bolstered its posture in the region (deploying additional forces and transferring advanced munitions to Israel) and eased constraints on Israeli action. Sensing the threat, Iran’s military staged air-defense drills around nuclear facilities like Fordow, Natanz, and Arak in early 2025. By late January, reports of an “imminent” Israeli attack began circulating, though Israeli officials insisted diplomacy was still on the table (reinforced by ongoing but uneasy U.S.-Iran backchannel talks).

* **Feb 8–26, 2025:** *Nuclear Breakout Fears & Deadline Set* – An unreleased International Atomic Energy Agency report (leaked in late February) revealed Iran had stockpiled **274.8 kg of 60% enriched uranium**, a dramatic 92.5 kg increase since November. This quantity is roughly **6.6 significant quantities** – enough, if further enriched, for several nuclear bombs. The report, and Iran’s continued curbs on inspector access, heightened international alarm. In response, Britain, France, and Germany (the E3) imposed a **June 2025 deadline** for Iran to return to a nuclear deal, warning that otherwise they would invoke the UN “snapback” mechanism to reimpose sanctions. Israel publicly welcomed the tougher stance while hinting that time to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran was running out. Iran, for its part, **categorically rejected** new negotiations at this stage, even as it held “nuclear defense” exercises and IRGC commanders issued menacing vows to strike U.S. and Israeli targets if attacked.

* **March–April 2025:** *Shadow War Intensifies, Talks Falter* – Throughout early spring, a series of mysterious explosions and accidents struck Iranian military sites. Open-source intelligence and regional media reported blasts at a missile development warehouse and an air-defense radar site inside Iran – incidents widely attributed to Israeli or allied covert action. Indeed, Israeli security sources later revealed that Mossad and the IDF had been conducting **“a series of covert operations”** in Iran aimed at degrading its strategic missile array in advance of any open conflict. Meanwhile, diplomacy seesawed: on **April 12**, U.S. and Iranian negotiators met in Oman for a sixth round of indirect nuclear talks. Progress was scant – Iran’s Supreme Leader Khamenei grudgingly allowed talks under the growing threat of force, but he balked at U.S. demands seen as **“humiliating”**, such as halting all enrichment on Iranian soil. By late April, President Trump had issued a 60-day ultimatum for a deal, and CIA and Mossad assessments warned Iran was only weeks away from crossing the nuclear weapons threshold. Behind the scenes, Israel’s leadership prepared for a possible strike even as it coordinated with Washington; a mid-April visit to Tehran by IAEA chief Rafael Grossi underscored the urgency, with Grossi warning Iran was “not far” from a bomb.

* **May 2025:** *Proxy Clashes & Heightened Alerts* – Tensions spiked across the region. In early May, IRGC Navy forces in the Persian Gulf stepped up harassment of commercial shipping – including GPS jamming in the Strait of Hormuz – as Tehran hinted it could disrupt global oil trade if attacked. Iranian generals like Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami (IRGC Commander) toured forward bases, boasting the country was *“fully…ready”* to respond and could strike U.S. bases and Israeli cities with “hundreds of ballistic missiles” on short notice. Iran’s proxies also saber-rattled: Iran-backed militias in Iraq conducted live-fire drills, and Houthi rebels in Yemen – armed with long-range missiles – threatened to target Israel in solidarity. Israel, for its part, quietly accelerated contingency plans. Notably, the **Houthis’ capabilities were targeted** by a U.S.-backed campaign in Yemen around this time, and Israeli airstrikes in Syria picked off remaining Iranian weapons convoys, reflecting a broader effort to neutralize Iran’s retaliatory reach. The cumulative effect by late May was a **“weakening of the pro-Iranian axis”** – Hezbollah, Hamas, and other militias were in no shape for a new war – which emboldened Israel’s calculus.

* **Early June 2025:** *Final Warnings & Airspace Lockdown* – With the E3’s June deadline imminent, last-ditch diplomatic efforts flickered then broke down. The U.S. and E3 submitted a resolution at the June 11 IAEA Board of Governors meeting declaring Iran in **non-compliance** with its safeguards – a formal censure of Iran’s nuclear secrecy. Iran’s negotiating team, bristling at U.S. “maximalist” terms, insisted on delaying further talks; by June 10 Khamenei had flatly rejected a U.S. proposal that Iran cease all enrichment, calling it an insult. Sensing a storm, neighboring countries began taking precautions. On June 10, Iraq (a key overflight route) **closed its airspace** due to “potential security concerns” amid the looming regional tension. Jordan and Iran itself soon restricted civilian air traffic, and on June 12 Israel quietly placed its military on its highest alert. That evening (June 12), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his Security Cabinet. The ministers gave final approval for action, effectively green-lighting a pre-emptive strike on Iran’s nuclear apparatus. U.S. President Donald Trump and Netanyahu had spoken by phone earlier in the week – a call shrouded in secrecy and later subject to disinformation (Israel even floated false reports of a U.S.-Israel rift to mislead Tehran). In reality, Washington was **fully briefed** on the plan (“we knew everything,” Trump later remarked). As midnight approached on June 12, commercial flights across the Middle East were being canceled or rerouted, and Israeli airspace went quiet – an indication that something major was underway.

* **June 13, 2025 (Pre-dawn):** *Israel Strikes Iran – “Operation Rising Lion” Begins* – In the early hours of Friday, June 13, Israel launched an unprecedented surprise assault on Iran’s strategic infrastructure. Around **200 Israeli aircraft** – including F-35I stealth fighters and long-range strike fighters with tanker support – penetrated Iranian airspace before dawn. Simultaneously, covert teams of Mossad commandos already on the ground in Iran activated pre-planted explosives and *precision-guided* sabotage devices. These teams attacked Iran’s air defense network from within, knocking out “dozens of radars and surface-to-air missile launchers” just as Israeli jets swarmed in. The first wave of airstrikes hit **nuclear facilities** (notably Iran’s main underground enrichment complex at **Natanz**, which was rocked by heavy bombing), as well as Iran’s **missile production and storage sites** around Tehran and Isfahan. Concurrently, Israeli missiles struck IRGC command centers and the residences of several nuclear scientists in Tehran. By sunrise, Israel announced it had *“targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders”* in a massive preventive operation. Prime Minister Netanyahu addressed Israelis, invoking the Holocaust and calling Iran’s nuclear ambition an existential threat that Israel *“will remove… for as many days as it takes”*. The toll on Iran was severe. Initial reports indicated that at least **20 senior Iranian commanders** were killed, including the Iranian Armed Forces Chief of Staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri and IRGC Commander Hossein Salami. The head of the IRGC Aerospace Force (in charge of missiles), Amir Ali Hajizadeh, was also reportedly among those slain. Iranian state media later confirmed that **six leading nuclear scientists** died in the strikes (one of them Fereydoun Abbasi, a former nuclear program chief). Huge explosions devastated key research and military sites: witnesses near Natanz saw a fireball and felt the ground shake, and videos from Tehran showed flames at what was said to be a missile depot on the city’s outskirts. By mid-morning, **Tehran and several other cities were under attack**, with strikes continuing in waves; terrified residents crowded the streets in disbelief at the scale of the onslaught.

* **June 13, 2025 (Daytime):** *Aftermath and Leaders’ Reactions* – In Iran, the regime was stunned. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei went on state TV to denounce Israel’s “wicked and bloody hand,” vowing that the Zionist state would face *“a bitter fate”* for starting a war. Behind closed doors, panic gripped Iran’s leadership as they assessed the decapitation of many top commanders. The IRGC’s chain of command scrambled: Major General Mohammad Pakpour was hastily promoted to replace the slain Salami as IRGC commander, and in a letter to Khamenei he swore *“the gates of hell will open”* for the *“child-killing regime”* of Israel. Nevertheless, Iran held off on immediately unleashing its remaining forces, perhaps to gauge the extent of damage. Israeli leaders, meanwhile, struck a tone of grim resolve. Netanyahu insisted Israel had *“no fight with the people of Iran, only with the brutal dictatorship”* in Tehran – even suggesting this blow could pave the way for the Iranian people’s “liberation” from the clerical regime. In Israel, all civilian flights were grounded and major cities braced under air-raid alerts as a precaution. The United States publicly backed Israel’s right to self-defense. President Trump, while urging Iran to *“halt the bombing”* in response, noted it was “not too late” for Tehran to choose diplomacy over destruction. U.S. officials indicated that the planned nuclear talks set for June 15 in Oman were now unlikely to proceed given the outbreak of hostilities. An emergency meeting of the **UN Security Council** was convened in New York at Iran’s request to address “Israel’s unlawful aggression,” though any consensus was doubtful. In the region, reactions were mixed: Gulf Arab states quietly welcomed the blow to Iran’s nuclear program but issued cautious statements urging restraint, and ordered state media to avoid inflammatory rhetoric. Oil prices spiked on fears of wider war, prompting OPEC to monitor the situation (though no facilities had been hit). By late afternoon, amidst widespread power outages in parts of Tehran, anti-aircraft fire sporadically lit up the sky as Iranian air defenses remained on high alert for further Israeli sorties.

* **June 13, 2025 (Evening):** *Iran’s Retaliatory Missile Salvo & Ongoing Strikes* – That night, Iran struck back directly. Around sunset, sirens sounded across Israel – from **Tel Aviv to Jerusalem** – as Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles from its territory. Iran’s state news agency IRNA claimed “hundreds” of missiles were fired in retaliation for *“Israel’s biggest ever attacks on Iran”*, explicitly citing the strike that *“blasted Iran’s huge underground nuclear site at Natanz”* and killed Iran’s top generals. Israelis hunkered in bomb shelters as the first inbound missiles were detected. Thanks to Israel’s multi-layered air defenses (Arrow and David’s Sling systems for longer-range missiles, plus Iron Dome for any shorter-range threats), the **majority of Iranian missiles were intercepted in the air** – dramatic nighttime images showed interceptor missiles streaking over Tel Aviv and explosions in the sky as they destroyed incoming warheads. A few missiles evaded interceptors: one long-range missile launched from Yemen by the Iran-aligned Houthi militia traveled over 1,500 km and **landed near Hebron** in the West Bank, injuring three bystanders with shrapnel. This highlighted the danger of Iran’s remaining proxy capabilities, though Houthi missile fire was a token gesture and their ability to sustain attacks was limited. Crucially, the **U.S. military intervened** in this phase: using assets in the Gulf, U.S. Navy Aegis destroyers and Patriot batteries helped shoot down several Iranian missiles headed toward Israel, underscoring Washington’s active support. In tandem with Iran’s retaliation, Israel expanded its offensive into a second wave. As night fell, loud blasts were reported at Iran’s Fordow uranium enrichment site (near Qom) – a facility left untouched in the morning strike was now hit in the evening strikes. Israeli jets also struck additional IRGC missile launch bases and drone facilities that Iran had not yet used. The Iranian capital experienced more explosions on its outskirts, and witnesses in Isfahan heard blasts as Israel targeted a nuclear-related site there too. By late night on June 13, active combat had somewhat abated, but the situation remained extremely volatile. Iran’s Revolutionary Guard vowed this was only the beginning of its response, threatening to activate allies across the region (though in reality many of those forces were in no condition to fight). Iranian media showed images of **wrecked buildings and rubble in Tehran**, asserting that nearly **80 civilians** were killed (including families of targeted scientists) and 300 wounded by the Israeli strikes – claims that fueled anger among Iranians. Spontaneous demonstrations broke out in Tehran both against Israel (with hardliners chanting “Death to Israel” in front of a smoldering Israeli flag effigy) and, more quietly in some quarters, against the regime for failing to protect the country. The full extent of damage to Iran’s nuclear program was not immediately clear – Israeli officials hinted that Natanz and other sites were heavily damaged but may not be completely destroyed. Both sides appeared to be reassessing their next moves as the first day of open conflict in this long-simmering feud came to a close.

## Analysis

### Motivations Behind Israel’s Operations

Israel’s overarching motivation has been to **prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons at all costs**, a goal viewed in Israel as a matter of national survival. Iranian leaders have repeatedly called for the end of the Israeli state, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his security chiefs have long warned that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose an *“existential threat”* to the Jewish state. In his address launching the Iran campaign, Netanyahu explicitly framed the strikes as a pre-emptive act to **“defeat an existential threat”**, invoking the historical failure to stop the Holocaust as a lesson. From Israel’s perspective, diplomacy and past agreements (like the 2015 JCPOA) had **failed to halt Iran’s nuclear advances**, especially after the U.S. withdrawal from the deal and Iran’s subsequent ramp-up of enrichment. By early 2025, Iran was enriching uranium to 60%, a hair’s breadth from weapons-grade, and amassing a stockpile sufficient for multiple bombs. Israeli leaders felt time was running out before Iran entered a “zone of immunity” (where enough of its nuclear infrastructure would be hidden or hardened to withstand attack). Thus, *deterrence through demonstrative action* became a key motive: the major strike on June 13 was intended to **“remove this threat”** before it could fully mature.

Another critical motivation was **shaping strategic conditions for a more favorable outcome**, be it a new diplomatic deal or even regime change in Tehran. Top Israeli officials and analysts indicated that Israel does not believe it can permanently eliminate Iran’s nuclear program by force alone (at least not without U.S. involvement). Instead, the show of force was designed to **“create the conditions for a long-term deal”** on better terms. Israel’s National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi publicly stated that military action by itself would likely not destroy all of Iran’s nuclear capacity, but it could *“compel Iran to sign an agreement that denies it the ability to develop nuclear weapons”* – essentially driving Tehran back to the negotiating table under duress. This logic aligns with the concept of a “signaling strike”: Israel demonstrated its willingness to go to war, hoping Iran (and the world powers) would opt for a diplomatic solution on Israel’s terms rather than face continued Israeli military action. Indeed, President Trump’s administration appeared to coordinate with this approach, immediately urging Tehran to negotiate *“before there is nothing left”* of its nuclear program.

Israel was also motivated by a sense that **Iran’s regional position had weakened**, presenting a window of opportunity. By 2025, Iran’s “axis of resistance” was in disarray: Hezbollah in Lebanon had been badly bloodied in a confrontation with Israel the year prior, losing much of its leadership and arsenal. Hamas in Gaza had similarly been hit hard (likely referring to the 2024 conflict), and crucially, Syria’s pro-Iranian regime under Bashar al-Assad had fallen amid renewed civil strife. This collapse of the Assad regime and the severe attrition of Iran’s proxy forces removed the specter of a two- or three-front war that had long constrained Israeli action. With Hezbollah and Hamas temporarily deterred or diminished and Syria no longer a secure Iranian staging ground, Israeli planners saw a reduced risk of massive retaliation against Israeli civilians in the event of striking Iran. An Israeli regional expert summarized this shift starkly: *“The Iranian empire is in decline… its most powerful proxy \[Hezbollah] is in no position to respond”*. In other words, Israel’s window to strike Iran’s nuclear program *without igniting a regional conflagration* had opened wider. This assessment fueled the decision to act sooner rather than later, before Iran could rebuild its proxy network or further fortify its nuclear sites.

Additionally, domestic and ideological factors played a role. Netanyahu has built much of his political legacy on being tough on Iran, often warning that Israel would act alone if necessary. Facing domestic controversies (such as protests over judicial reforms earlier in 2025), the unity brought on by an external threat may have been a politically unifying distraction – though it’s widely agreed that the primary driver was strategic, not merely political expediency. Israel’s leadership, including war-seasoned figures in the defense establishment, genuinely viewed Iran’s imminent nuclear capability as a point of no return. Some in Israel’s security cabinet were also influenced by the prospect of **sparking change within Iran**. The breadth of targets on June 13 – not only nuclear facilities but also IRGC leadership – indicates a bid to **“sow internal doubt”** and possibly encourage regime instability. Netanyahu’s direct appeal to the Iranian populace in his speech (emphasizing that Israel’s fight was with the *“brutal dictatorship”* and expressing hope for their *“liberation”*) hinted at a regime-change undercurrent to the operation. By decapitating key figures like Salami, Bagheri, and Hajizadeh, Israel intended to *“shake Iran’s leadership to the core”* and perhaps catalyze public unrest or elite fragmentation. This is a controversial gambit – essentially mixing strategic military goals with the hope of political outcomes – but it aligns with long-standing Israeli and Western frustration that Iran’s regime uses external conflicts to justify its repression and nuclear ambitions. Weakening that regime from within, in Israel’s view, would complement the goal of ending its nuclear program and aggressive regional policies.

In summary, Israel’s motivations combined *immediate security imperatives* (stopping a nuclear bomb) with *broader strategic ambitions* (forcing Iran’s hand toward a better deal or even regime moderation) at a moment when Iran appeared isolated and vulnerable. The result was a carefully prepared campaign – years in the making – that unfolded once conditions were judged optimal. As one former Mossad analyst noted, many components of this operation “took years to put together”, reflecting how deeply rooted and long-planned Israel’s motivations were.

### Iran’s Strategic and Military Responses

Iran’s response to Israel’s offensive has been fierce in rhetoric but constrained in practice, reflecting the regime’s limited options in the face of severe setbacks. Strategically, Tehran faces a dilemma: it **must retaliate enough to satisfy domestic demands for revenge and re-establish deterrence**, yet it must avoid over-escalation that could invite even more devastating Israeli or American attacks. In the immediate term, Iran chose a direct but measured military response – launching **ballistic missiles directly at Israel’s cities** on June 13. This was a significant escalation (Iran had never before openly fired missiles at Israeli population centers from its own territory), intended to signal that an attack on the Iranian homeland would *not* go unanswered. IRNA, Iran’s official news outlet, framed the salvo as proportional retaliation for Israel’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and leaders. However, Iran notably targeted major cities (Tel Aviv, Jerusalem) rather than, for instance, Dimona (Israel’s nuclear facility) or U.S. bases – likely calculating that aiming at civilian centers would terrorize Israel but still afford some chance that missiles could be intercepted (as indeed most were). Had Iran aimed at Dimona or mass-caused casualties, it might have crossed a U.S./Israeli red line triggering immediate counter-retaliation on Iranian soil. As it happened, **no Israeli deaths** were initially reported from Iran’s missile attack due to successful defense intercepts, highlighting Iran’s challenge in exacting pain on a foe with superior defenses.

Iran’s other military response options are hampered by the attrition of its proxy network and the preparedness of its adversaries. The traditional Iranian playbook for confronting Israel and the U.S. includes using regional proxies (Hezbollah, militias in Syria/Iraq, Hamas, Houthis) to stretch Israel across multiple fronts and hit U.S. assets. Yet as noted, **Hezbollah publicly indicated it would *not* join the fray** this time, out of fear of provoking massive Israeli retaliation in Lebanon. Hezbollah’s arsenal and leadership were significantly diminished by a war with Israel in 2024, leaving it in a poor state to open a new front. Likewise, **Hamas in Gaza is in no condition to fight a new war**, having been “decimated” in prior clashes. Iran’s proxy in Yemen, the Houthi movement, managed a token response by firing a missile toward Israel (underscoring that they are one of the last Iranian-allied forces still capable of striking Israel at long range). However, beyond that single missile, the Houthis face their own ceasefire constraints and the threat of Saudi/UAE retaliation if they fully enter the war. Iranian-linked militias in Iraq and Syria are also constrained – U.S. and Israeli strikes over the past year have weakened those groups, and the collapse of the Assad regime disrupted Iran’s supply lines through Syria.

Given this proxy paralysis, Iran’s remaining military avenues are **direct and asymmetric strikes**. We have seen the direct missile strikes on Israel. Iran could also target U.S. forces in the region, as its commanders have repeatedly threatened. IRGC commander Salami (before his death) and other officials vowed that if Iran were attacked, **“\[we] will attack \[US and Israeli] security without hesitation”**. This implies missile or drone attacks on U.S. bases in Gulf states or Iraq, or against U.S. Navy ships in the Persian Gulf. Indeed, U.S. bases in Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE, and Bahrain are within range of Iran’s ballistic missiles. However, Iran knows hitting U.S. forces directly could trigger American retaliation on Iranian soil, massively expanding the war. Thus far, Tehran’s retaliation has *avoided U.S. targets*, likely deliberately. Instead, Iran might pursue asymmetric harassment: for example, attempting to close or disrupt the **Strait of Hormuz**, through which a significant share of global oil flows. In May and early June, there were signs of this approach – GPS jamming of ships and threats to commercial shipping emerged as part of Iran’s deterrence messaging. Since the June 13 strike, the Iranian Navy and IRGC naval units have been on high alert. We may see Iran try to seize oil tankers or attack Gulf shipping routes to raise the economic costs for the international community (something Iran has done episodically in past standoffs). The UK Maritime Trade Operations issued warnings about this risk as tensions spiked.

**Cyber warfare** is another key response domain for Iran. Iran possesses capable cyber units that in the past have hit infrastructure in Israel, Saudi Arabia, and even Europe. In the wake of the June 13 attacks, Iranian or Iran-aligned hackers might retaliate by attempting to disrupt Israeli critical services (power grids, water systems, financial institutions) or spread disinformation. Such cyber strikes can be deniable and reduce the pressure on Iran to respond overtly. Israel is braced for this: it has ramped up cyber defenses and might counter-hack Iranian systems (Iran’s rail network and gas stations have been cyber-sabotaged in recent years by suspected Israeli operations). While concrete cyber events are not yet confirmed post-strike, this battle is likely happening in parallel.

Iran’s **strategic messaging** in response has been twofold: externally, it portrays Israel’s attack as *illegal aggression* to galvanize international sympathy, and internally, it frames the conflict as a nationalist rallying cause. The Iranian Foreign Ministry blasted the Israeli strikes as *“unlawful and cowardly”* and lodged formal protests at the UN. Tehran’s letter to the UN Security Council asserted it will respond *“decisively and proportionally”* to Israel’s acts, seeking to justify any future retaliation as rightful self-defense. Iran is leveraging diplomatic channels – Russia and China, which have been more sympathetic to Iran, could be lobbied to condemn Israel and block any UN sanctions. (Russia’s President Putin, for instance, reportedly urged Israel to **“use diplomacy, not bombs”** in a call after the attack.) However, given U.S. backing of Israel, the UNSC route is likely to yield little beyond statements.

Internally, the regime is in damage-control mode. There is credible reporting of **panic and confusion within Iran’s leadership** after the strikes. The loss of high-ranking officers is a major blow to command-and-control, and the regime is doubtless rotating in replacements (as seen with Pakpour taking over the IRGC). Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guards are doubling down on calls for unity and resistance. IRGC-basij militia units have been deployed in major cities not only for air defense but also to deter any civil unrest. Iran’s public reaction is mixed: some citizens, horrified by the strikes and nationalistically angered, are rallying behind the flag – one Basij member in Qom declared *“I will fight and die for our right to a nuclear program… Israel and America cannot take it away”*. Yet there are reports of others quietly welcoming the pressure on the hardline regime, hoping it might lead to change. The regime’s response to any protests will likely be swift repression, as in the past. If demonstrations grow (for example, if long lines for cash or supplies appear due to panic), Iran’s security forces may crack down harshly. The leadership knows that showing weakness could fuel dissent, so expect a performative display of strength – such as missile test launches, public funerals for “martyrs” (the slain commanders) to incite outrage, and possibly symbolic strikes (even if militarily ineffective) to save face.

Looking ahead, Iran’s strategy might pivot to a **protracted, clandestine retaliation campaign** – the kind of **“clandestine warfare”** they employed in the 1980s, as one analyst noted. This could mean terror attacks on Israeli or Jewish civilian targets abroad (as Iran’s agents did in Argentina in the 1990s), assassination attempts against Israeli or Western officials, or bombing soft targets like embassies and commercial hubs. Such indirect responses can be calibrated to inflict pain while maintaining plausible deniability or at least stopping short of all-out war. Already, Western intelligence agencies are reportedly on high alert for Iranian Quds Force plots against Israeli diplomats or American military officers in various countries.

One escalatory card Iran holds in reserve is its **nuclear posture**. In desperation, Tehran could choose to abandon ambiguity and rush openly toward nuclear weapons – for instance, by withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and enriching uranium to 90% weapons grade. This “nuclear option” is seen by Iran’s hardliners as a way to deter further attacks: if Iran were perceived to be on the cusp of a bomb, it might make Israel/US pause (or conversely, it might trigger even more strikes). Thus far, Iran has not taken this step, likely calculating that it would indeed be tantamount to inviting full-scale war. But if Iran’s leaders conclude they have nothing left to lose, they might accelerate nuclear activities in secret, hoping to present the world with a fait accompli. There are unconfirmed reports that Iran has moved some stockpiles to more secure secret sites and may start enriching small quantities to higher levels in hardened locations. The IAEA, which found Iran in violation of safeguards just before the conflict, will have even less visibility now. This remains a dangerous wild card in Iran’s playbook.

In summary, Iran’s responses so far demonstrate a combination of **restraint and resolve**: Tehran retaliated in a limited but direct way, is exploring asymmetric levers like regional disruption and cyber action, and is fighting a public relations battle to turn global opinion against Israel. However, Iran is also **hemorrhaging strategically** – its deterrence credibility has been damaged, and it is largely isolated, with even allied groups unable or unwilling to come to its aid. The regime’s priority will be to avoid actions that could lead to its own collapse or invite overwhelming U.S. intervention, while still punishing Israel over time. This delicate balancing act will shape Iran’s next moves, which could be drawn out over weeks or months rather than an immediate dramatic counterstrike. Iran might seek to **“set the terms of its decline”** (as one regional expert put it) through negotiations eventually, rather than through military means – but it will first attempt to show that it can exact a price for Israel’s aggression, hoping to deter any further attacks during this conflict.

### Roles of Key International and Regional Actors

**United States:** The United States has played a critical but somewhat dual role in this crisis – both as a facilitator of Israel’s campaign and as a potential moderator to limit escalation. By 2025, U.S. policy under the Trump administration aligned closely with Israel’s hard line on Iran’s nuclear program. In the lead-up to the strikes, the U.S. provided significant support: deploying additional military assets to the Middle East and even transferring specialized weaponry (such as bunker-buster munitions and air refueling tankers) to bolster Israel’s strike capability. U.S. and Israeli forces held **joint exercises** practicing long-range bombing runs, sending a strong signal to Tehran. Washington’s **diplomatic posture** – withdrawing from the JCPOA in 2018 and then engaging in on-off talks in 2024–25 – also created leverage. U.S. officials warned Iran repeatedly that *“all options are on the table”* if it pursued a bomb, lending credibility to Israel’s threats. When Israel ultimately struck on June 13, it is evident the U.S. was not caught off guard. President Trump noted *“we knew everything”* about Israel’s plans, implying U.S. intelligence and military were in close coordination. Indeed, shortly after Israel’s strikes, **U.S. military assets intervened to protect Israel** – two U.S. officials confirmed that American systems helped shoot down some Iranian missiles heading toward Israel. This direct assistance underscores that the U.S. is effectively siding with Israel in the conflict, at least to the extent of defense. Politically, the U.S. has also shielded Israel in international fora, likely vetoing any UNSC resolution condemning Israel’s actions. However, Washington is also keen to **prevent a wider regional war** that could endanger its forces and destabilize oil markets. Thus, Trump and his advisors have been urging Iran to *stop* its retaliation and return to talks – even after hostilities began, Trump floated that *“it’s not too late”* for Iran to make a deal on its nuclear program. The U.S. is leveraging the **“carrot and stick”** approach: backing Israel’s hard blows (stick) but also offering Iran a diplomatic off-ramp (carrot) to avoid total destruction. Going forward, the U.S. role could expand if Iran targets U.S. assets or tries to close Hormuz – in that case, expect the U.S. to conduct its own strikes on Iranian military targets. Conversely, if Israel’s campaign achieves its immediate goals, Washington might step in to broker a ceasefire or new negotiations, effectively acting as the **broker of a long-term solution** (something Israeli officials like Hanegbi explicitly desire the U.S. to lead). Notably, **domestic U.S. politics** also play a role: President Trump faces an election year in 2025–26, and a successful hardline stance against Iran (without a messy war) could be politically advantageous, while an out-of-control conflict could be a liability. This gives the U.S. incentive to calibrate the conflict carefully.

**Hezbollah (Lebanon):** Hezbollah has historically been Iran’s most powerful regional proxy and was long expected to retaliate against Israel if Israel struck Iran. However, as multiple sources indicate, Hezbollah is **in a weak position in 2025** and has so far remained on the sidelines. In the days leading up to the Israeli strikes, **security sources close to Hezbollah told Reuters that the group would not join any retaliatory action by Iran**, fearing it would *“unleash a new Israeli blitz on Lebanon.”* This reflects the aftermath of a major Israel–Hezbollah war in 2024 that left Hezbollah militarily crippled – thousands of its fighters were killed, and large swathes of its strongholds in southern Lebanon and Beirut’s suburbs were destroyed. Many of Hezbollah’s seasoned commanders were lost, mirroring the decapitation Iran itself has now suffered. Consequently, Hezbollah’s leadership (now under Hassan Nasrallah or possibly a successor if Nasrallah’s health faltered) appears to have made a calculated decision to **preserve what remains of the organization** rather than sacrifice it in a futile gesture of solidarity. This is a significant development: it means Israel did not have to fight on its northern front while striking Iran, a scenario Israeli planners have long feared. For now, Hezbollah’s role is one of *restrained passivity*. It has raised its alert level in case Israel decides to pre-emptively hit remaining Hezbollah assets, but it has kept its rocket arsenals silent. The Lebanese government, for its part, has urged calm, fearing that any Hezbollah involvement would bring ruin to Lebanon which is already in economic crisis. Some scattered protests in Beirut by pro-Iran factions have called on Hezbollah to “do something,” but the prevailing reality is that Hezbollah *cannot afford another war*. The group might limit itself to rhetoric condemning Israel and perhaps covertly assisting Iran in other arenas (for example, by helping smuggle Iranian operatives or weapons through Syria/Iraq if possible). Importantly, Hezbollah’s sidelining in this conflict marks a **major shift in the regional balance** – Israel has effectively neutralized one of Iran’s ace cards, at least for now. However, one cannot entirely rule out Hezbollah joining if the conflict drags on and Iran’s regime explicitly calls in its last favors; but even then, it would likely be a token effort or a limited front (perhaps a few rockets or drone incursions to save face). Israeli deterrence established in 2024 appears to be holding: Hezbollah knows another all-out war could spell its end. Thus, the **Lebanese front remains quiet** as of now, much to Israel’s relief and Iran’s frustration.

**Gulf Arab States:** The Sunni Arab monarchies of the Gulf – particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – find themselves in a complex position. Publicly, they have been *muted and cautious* in their response to the Israel-Iran hostilities. Immediately after the Israeli strikes, Gulf governments **issued internal directives to avoid provocative statements** that might “anger Iran”. This reflects their fear of being targeted by an Iranian backlash; Gulf states host U.S. military bases and lie geographically between Israel and Iran (Israeli jets likely overflew parts of the Gulf en route to Iran). Indeed, any **widening of the war could swiftly expand to the Gulf states**, as they would be in the line of fire of Iranian missiles and drones. Consequently, countries like **Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, and Qatar** closed or restricted parts of their airspace when the conflict erupted, and airlines diverted flights to avoid the Gulf warzone. Despite their cautious public stance, however, many Gulf states privately welcome strikes against Iran’s nuclear and military capabilities. Iran’s regional power and interference (from Yemen to Bahrain) have long been a chief security concern for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Saudi Arabia, in particular, considers a nuclear-armed Iran an existential threat nearly as much as Israel does. Notably, Saudi-Israeli backchannel contacts reportedly intensified in early 2025, with Riyadh being kept informed by Washington about potential Israeli action. The **director of the Gulf Research Center**, a Saudi think tank, commented that Iran has now been *“backed into a corner with limited options”* and might have to privately concede on its nuclear ambitions after this shock. This mirrors the Gulf Arab hope that the Israeli operation will force Iran to become more pliable or weaken the regime that they see as aggressive and expansionist. At the same time, Gulf leaders are nervous – if Iran were to retaliate broadly, the Gulf’s oil facilities or cities could be targets. Thus, **civil defense in the UAE and Saudi Arabia is on high alert**, and the U.S. has likely assured the Gulf states of extended air defense coverage (indeed, American THAAD and Patriot batteries in the Gulf are scanning the skies for any Iranian launches). Economically, the Gulf states are also concerned: war risk has spiked oil prices (Brent crude jumped on the news), which short-term boosts revenue but threatens the stability of global markets and could trigger international pressure for them to increase production or mediate. OPEC, led by Saudi, stated that the escalation “did not justify immediate changes” to oil output – a careful stance to avoid signaling panic. In quiet diplomatic channels, Gulf diplomats may act as intermediaries: Oman and Qatar maintain lines to Tehran and could convey messages between Iran and the U.S./Israel to de-escalate, if asked. In sum, the Gulf states’ role is **quietly supportive of Israel’s goal (curbing Iran)** while being **publicly neutral and focused on self-protection**. They will continue balancing these interests: containing Iran’s influence is their strategic win if Israel succeeds, but they will also press Washington to rein in Israel should Iran contemplate attacking them directly, seeking to avoid becoming battlegrounds themselves.

**Syria:** Syria’s role in this conflict is markedly different than it would have been a few years ago, due to dramatic developments within Syria itself. The **Assad regime’s downfall** sometime in the past year has removed a key Iranian ally from the chessboard. During the long Syrian civil war (2011–2023), Iran had built a significant military presence in Syria – recruiting militias, deploying IRGC units, and using Syrian territory to supply Hezbollah. With Assad gone and presumably a period of chaos or transition in Syria, Iran’s foothold has largely crumbled. Many IRGC and proxy forces likely had to withdraw or go to ground amid Syria’s upheaval. This means Syria is no longer the convenient **launchpad for Iranian retaliation against Israel** that it once was. In previous eras, Iran could respond to Israeli actions by, say, firing rockets from Syrian soil or allowing militias to attack Israel’s Golan Heights frontier. Now, with possibly hostile or fragmented forces controlling Syria, Iran’s assets there are vulnerable. In the immediate conflict, Israel did **not** have to worry about Syrian-based missiles or air defenses interfering in its Iran strike – a huge relief for Israeli planners. (It’s plausible that part of Israel’s October 2024 strike mentioned earlier was also aimed at remaining Iranian infrastructure in Syria, completing the job of severing that corridor.) For Iran, the loss of Syria is a strategic setback that limits its response options. Reports suggest that some Iraqi Shia militias that were in Syria have tried relocating to western Iraq to be closer to Syria/Israel, but they lack the cover they once had. Interestingly, **Israel’s attack may have been indirectly facilitated by Syria’s airspace situation** – with no strong central government, Israeli aircraft might have transited Syrian airspace without clear opposition on the way to Iran, or via Jordan/Iraq corridors as they were closed by allies right before the strike. Russia, which maintains a presence in Syria, ostensibly still controls some airspace there but likely stood down to avoid confrontation with Israel/US during the Iran strike (Moscow’s focus is elsewhere given global tensions). Going forward, Syria is unlikely to become an active theater in this Israel-Iran conflict unless remnants of pro-Iran forces there attempt some token action. One scenario could be Iran directing any loyal militias in Syria to fire one-off rockets toward Israel’s Golan or to attack U.S. troops stationed in eastern Syria. However, with **Assad’s regime collapsed**, any such actions would be fragmented and easily attributable to Iran, inviting Israeli or American retaliation. Thus, Syria’s primary role is as a *cautionary tale* and contributing factor: the collapse of Assad signified the **unprecedented weakening of Iran’s regional axis**, exacerbating Iran’s strategic vulnerabilities. It also demonstrates to Iran that its influence can evaporate quickly, possibly adding to Tehran’s sense of urgency and desperation in the face of Israeli aggression.

**Other Actors:** It’s worth noting briefly the roles of a few additional players. **Russia** and **China** have been Iran’s diplomatic shields to an extent. Russia, a longtime ally of Iran in Syria and a rival of the U.S., expressed deep alarm at the outbreak of hostilities. The Kremlin has publicly called for an immediate halt to fighting and reportedly President Putin personally urged Netanyahu to **“pursue diplomacy instead of bombs”** in resolving disputes with Iran. However, beyond rhetoric, Russia’s capacity is limited. Engaged in its own conflict in Ukraine, Moscow is unlikely to intervene militarily. It may try to organize talks or offer to mediate (as it did during earlier nuclear negotiations), but Israel and the U.S. view Russia as biased toward Iran, and Iran, while appreciative of moral support, knows Russia won’t fight on its behalf. **China**, which brokered a détente between Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2023, also called for restraint and probably offered to facilitate dialogue. Beijing values regional stability for energy security and will oppose anything threatening Gulf oil flow. Yet China also won’t directly confront the U.S. or Israel over this; it will work via the UN or quiet channels. The **United Nations** as mentioned convened, but the Security Council is deadlocked – Western members back Israel’s right to prevent a nuclear Iran, while Russia/China criticize Israel’s force. Hence, no unified action will emerge there. **European powers (E3)**, though upset at Iran’s nuclear breaches, are uncomfortable with unilateral military action. France, the UK, and Germany have expressed support for Israel’s security but also concern about escalation. They may double down on the stance that Iran should have taken the deal offered and now encourage Iran to restrain itself to avoid worse outcomes. Europe could potentially propose a new diplomatic initiative once the dust settles (e.g. a ceasefire in exchange for Iran freezing enrichment entirely). **Turkey** is another regional actor to watch; while not directly involved, Turkey has complicated relations with both Iran and Israel. Ankara has in the past coordinated with Tehran, but also with Israel at times, and with Assad gone Turkey likely has influence in northern Syria. President Erdogan has condemned the strikes on Iran, calling them destabilizing, but he is also wary of Iran’s regional meddling. Turkey might try to leverage this by pushing its own standing (perhaps conducting operations against PKK or other groups while everyone’s distracted, as some reports of Turkish strikes in Syria in Feb 2025 indicated). Overall, these actors play supporting or background roles – the primary drivers remain Israel, Iran, and the U.S., with regional proxies largely neutralized.

**Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Insights:** Throughout this crisis, OSINT – information from commercial satellite imagery, flight tracking data, and on-the-ground social media – has been invaluable in corroborating events. For example, even before official statements, **satellite images likely showed damage at Natanz and other sites** shortly after the strikes, giving non-governmental experts evidence of what was hit. OSINT analysts observed unusual Israeli Air Force activity in the days prior (such as tanker aircraft patterns suggesting long-range strike prep) and noted the sudden **emptying of Israel’s civilian airspace** on the night of June 12/13, which signaled an operation was underway. Amateur videos posted on Twitter by Iranians captured the **glow of explosions and tracer fire over Tehran** in real time, providing visual confirmation of strikes on targets like missile bases. OSINT also picked up Iran’s missile launches – for instance, sensors and eyewitnesses in the region tracked trajectories of missiles heading west, which lined up with Israel’s reports of incoming fire. Moreover, OSINT monitors of aviation noted the diversion of thousands of flights and closure of regional air corridors in response to the conflict, illustrating the immediate global impact on commerce. Think tanks and security researchers (e.g. Institute for the Study of War, INSS, Gulf Research Center) have actively used open data to assess the conflict’s progression: ISW’s daily Iran updates compiled signals like the June 11 **UKMTO maritime warning** and Iran’s dispersal of air defenses as clues that something was imminent. These open-source pieces often fill in gaps left by official accounts. For instance, while Israel was tight-lipped on details of the strike beforehand, OSINT noted the forward deployment of Israeli drones (the Reuters report later confirmed Israel had even established a *secret drone base near Tehran* for the operation). In essence, OSINT has democratized the understanding of this conflict, allowing independent verification of claims by both sides. One should note, however, that the fog of war includes disinformation – Iranian media initially made grand claims of civilian casualties and resilient nuclear capabilities, some of which OSINT will test against imagery evidence in the coming days (e.g. if Natanz’s halls appear collapsed in photos, it belies any Iranian denial of damage). So far, OSINT findings largely align with the narrative that Israel achieved significant surprise and damage, while Iran’s retaliation was largely blunted by defenses.

**Competing Interpretations and Uncertainty:** It is important to recognize that not all analysts or policymakers interpret this unfolding conflict in the same way. There is a **debate over Israel’s ultimate aims**. Some view the June 13 operation as a narrowly focused counter-proliferation strike – essentially an extension of the Begin Doctrine (prevent hostile states from going nuclear) – with the goal of buying time and forcing Iran to negotiate. The evidence for this is Israel’s own framing: Netanyahu said the campaign’s aim is to *“prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon”*, and Israeli officials have emphasized that if the U.S. joins diplomatically, a new deal could result. In this interpretation, Israel does not seek a wider war or regime change per se, and will calibrate its campaign to avoid unnecessary Iranian civilian harm (to keep the door open for a climb-down). However, *others* argue that Israel’s strikes went beyond nuclear facilities to target the regime’s pillars (the IRGC, scientists, etc.), indicating a **broader objective of crippling Iran’s regional power and possibly inciting regime collapse**. These analysts point to Netanyahu’s unusually ideological rhetoric about the “brutal dictatorship” and the simultaneous elimination of so much of Iran’s top brass as evidence that Israel aims to fundamentally weaken (if not topple) the Islamic Republic. This view suggests the campaign may not stop at just a one-off strike but could continue to hit regime targets, hoping Iran’s system cannot withstand the strain.

On the Iranian side, there are competing views on how they will respond if the conflict drags on. One school of thought is that Iran, cornered and furious, will **escalate asymmetrically** and never capitulate – meaning we could see a prolonged and expanding conflict (the leadership’s defiant tone and vows of a “bitter fate” for Israel back this up). Another view, however, is that **Iran will exercise strategic patience**: absorb the blows, avoid a full war, and retaliate in slow, covert ways over time (for instance, wait months then strike an Israeli or Western target abroad when the spotlight has moved on). Iran’s relatively *muted immediate retaliation* (missiles that largely caused minimal damage) could indicate a reluctance to go fully toe-to-toe with Israel’s military might, especially with the U.S. involved. Iranian pragmatists might be counseling Khamenei that survival of the regime and preservation of some nuclear capability (even if hidden) is better than a martyr’s last stand. We simply do not know how cohesive the Iranian leadership is right now – reports hint at internal concern and blame-casting. It’s uncertain if hardliners like the Revolutionary Guard will push for a more violent response (to avenge their fallen comrades), or if political figures will seek a secret channel to de-escalate.

Another area of uncertainty is **how effective Israel’s strikes truly were**. Israeli officials claim the operation was a huge success, knocking out significant portions of Iran’s nuclear program and missile forces in one blow. Two regional sources called it a *“stunning decapitation”* of Iran’s military leadership, *“reminiscent”* of how Israel wiped out Hezbollah’s leadership in 2024. Yet, independent verification of the damage to deeply buried nuclear sites (like Fordow or Natanz’s centrifuge halls) is pending. Iran will surely conceal as much as possible. Sima Shine of INSS cautioned that without U.S. involvement, **Israel probably could not completely eliminate Iran’s nuclear project**. That suggests there may be surviving elements – perhaps some centrifuges in Fordow were spared in the first wave, or Iran’s knowledge and some stockpile could allow it to rebuild. If Iran’s program is not fully destroyed, Israel faces the uncertainty of what Tehran might salvage or accelerate in secret. Additionally, while many IRGC leaders were killed, Iran’s system has depth – younger commanders will step up (like Pakpour). The psychological impact is huge, but the IRGC as an institution may regroup and still pursue its agenda, albeit weakened.

There are also differing interpretations about the role of the **United States** in this conflict. Some in Israel believe that with Trump in office, the U.S. essentially gave a green light for Israel to act and will back Israel to the hilt if Iran escalates. Others worry that if things spiral, the U.S. might restrain Israel to protect its own interests (like avoiding a direct war or keeping oil flowing). Trump’s comment that he “tried to save \[Iran] from humiliation and death” by pushing for a deal hints that the U.S. would prefer a quick diplomatic end – which could potentially mean pressing Israel to halt operations after initial success. If Iran surprisingly opted for talks now, would Israel pause its campaign? Such coordination is uncertain and could lead to friction if goals diverge (e.g., Israel wanting to strike additional targets vs. U.S. wanting to limit war).

Finally, there is uncertainty in the **domestic Iranian arena**: Will the Iranian public largely rally around the flag against the external threat, or will the shock and awe exacerbate anti-regime sentiment? The Reuters report cited an Iranian saying people were terrified and some saw this attack as possibly *“the beginning of the end”* for the regime. If protests erupt in Iran due to anger at the regime’s failure to prevent the attack (or due to general discontent amplified by the crisis), the regime’s focus could split between fighting Israel and quelling unrest at home. A harsh crackdown could further delegitimize the regime, yet being lenient risks uprisings. The stability of the Islamic Republic is at stake in a way it hasn’t been in decades, and analysts are divided on whether this external shock will strengthen the regime’s grip (by invoking nationalist unity) or weaken it (by highlighting government incompetence and driving factions to consider change). This will significantly influence how the conflict unfolds.

In summary, while the facts of the past months and days are coming into focus, **key questions remain open**: whether Israel will press its advantage or pause, whether Iran will escalate or seek an exit, how far the U.S. will go, and whether internal collapse or compromise might emerge in Iran. These uncertainties inform the various scenarios considered for the conflict’s future, as discussed next.

## Predictive Scenarios

Following the dramatic events of June 13, 2025, the Israel-Iran conflict could evolve in several major directions. Three plausible scenarios are outlined below, along with an assessment of their probability and the key variables that would influence each outcome:

### Scenario 1: **Full-Scale Regional War** (Probability: *Medium-Low*)

In this scenario, the current hostilities escalate into an outright war between Israel and Iran, drawing in multiple regional actors and potentially the United States. Iran would commit to a forceful retaliation beyond what we’ve seen – for example, launching additional waves of ballistic missiles (and perhaps cruise missiles or armed drones) not only at Israel but also at U.S. military bases in the Gulf. Such an escalation could prompt direct American military intervention against Iran (e.g. U.S. airstrikes on Iranian launch sites or nuclear facilities), effectively turning the conflict into a U.S.-Iran war as well. A full-scale war might also prod Iran’s proxies, even in their weakened state, to join the fray out of a sense of “now or never.” Hezbollah, despite its losses, could unleash whatever rocket arsenal it has left at Israeli cities; Shi’a militias in Iraq might bombard the U.S. embassy or bases; the Houthis in Yemen could fire a barrage of missiles at Saudi and Israeli targets. Israel, for its part, would respond with maximum force on all fronts – intensive bombardment of Hezbollah in Lebanon (even more devastating than 2024), strikes on militia bases in Iraq and Yemen, and continuous raids on Iranian infrastructure. The conflict could expand geographically to include the **Strait of Hormuz**, with Iran perhaps mining the strait or attacking oil tankers, leading to international naval intervention to keep shipping lanes open. At its peak, this scenario is essentially a regional war pitting Israel and the U.S. (and possibly some Gulf states quietly aiding them) against Iran and the remnants of its proxy network.

**Key Variables:** Several factors would drive the likelihood of this worst-case scenario. One is the **scale of Iranian retaliation**. If Iran’s leadership chooses to avenge the blow to its prestige with massive force – for instance, if Khamenei or the IRGC feel that not responding in kind would spell the regime’s demise – they might take the risk of firing many more missiles or encouraging terror attacks that inflict large Israeli or American casualties. A single successful strike causing high fatalities on the Israeli side could create popular pressure in Israel to hit back even harder, feeding the cycle of escalation. Another variable is a **miscalculation or accidental strike**: war can escalate by mistake, e.g., if an Iranian missile accidentally strikes a sensitive site like a chemicals facility in Israel causing mass casualties, or if Iran’s missiles aimed at Israel overshoot and hit Amman or Riyadh, dragging other nations directly into conflict. The posture of the **United States** is also critical – if U.S. assets suffer fatalities (say an Iranian missile hits a base and kills American troops), Washington would almost certainly retaliate militarily against Iran, broadening the war. U.S. involvement would significantly raise the conflict’s intensity, as Iran might then target Gulf Arab oil infrastructure or attempt to trigger a wider Muslim-world backlash. Additionally, the **internal Iranian decision-making** could drive escalation: if hardliners seize full control and oust any moderating voices, they may double down on confrontation, even at extreme cost. On the Israeli side, a variable is **time and objectives** – if Israel feels it must *finish* the job (e.g., if intelligence shows parts of Iran’s nuclear program survived and are being reconstituted), it might expand its target list to new sites or even consider using tactical means like electromagnetic pulse (EMP) or, in a nightmare scenario, its own unconventional options, which would be profoundly escalatory. Finally, the **role of Russia and China** could influence this scenario’s trajectory. If, for instance, Russia decided to covertly supply Iran with advanced air defenses or intelligence to bog down Israel/U.S., or if China broke from its usual restraint and threatened economic retaliation against those striking Iran, it could widen the conflict dimensions (though direct Russian/Chinese military involvement remains extremely unlikely). Overall, this scenario’s probability is assessed as medium-low because all sides know a full war would be immensely destructive. Iran would risk regime-ending strikes; Israel would face unprecedented home-front damage; the U.S. could be mired in another Middle East war. That said, **the possibility cannot be dismissed** – wars have erupted from smaller sparks. Should Iran overreach in its retaliation or should a single event inflame passions (a “Pearl Harbor” or “Sarajevo” moment), a broader war could erupt almost overnight.

### Scenario 2: **Contained Conflict Leading to a New Diplomatic Accord** (Probability: *High*)

In this scenario, the conflict remains limited in duration and scope, with both Israel and Iran (quietly nudged by the United States and other powers) choosing to step back from the brink after the initial exchanges. Essentially, Israel’s operation would achieve its primary objectives of severely setting back Iran’s nuclear program and demonstrating resolve, and then Israel would pause further strikes. Iran, having fired its retaliatory missile salvo largely to satisfy domestic honor, would refrain from major further military actions (beyond perhaps symbolic gestures or low-level asymmetric attacks). Intense international diplomacy would then kick in behind the scenes. The United States – leveraging Iran’s weakened position – could push for an **urgent diplomatic solution**: maybe not a full resurrection of the JCPOA, but an interim agreement where Iran agrees to verifiably halt all enrichment above a low percentage and ship out its 60% stockpile in exchange for assurances of no more strikes and perhaps limited sanctions relief. This would echo what some analysts referred to as using the strikes to *“compel Iran to sign an agreement… while maintaining the ability to pressure the regime”*. Under this scenario, negotiations (likely mediated by Oman, Qatar, or European powers) could yield a face-saving outcome: Iran publicly insists it resisted and only makes concessions due to the “unfair aggression,” but privately it offers to dismantle critical nuclear infrastructure. Israel, for its part, could declare victory – having removed the immediate threat. A monitoring mechanism (involving the IAEA with beefed-up inspections) might be put in place to ensure Iran’s compliance, addressing Israel’s core demand of no Iranian bomb. Over time, some **sanctions might be reimposed on Iran through UN snapback** to keep pressure (or lifted incrementally if Iran cooperates). This scenario might also involve regional security understandings: for instance, quiet guarantees that Hezbollah will not rearm (with Russia perhaps agreeing to stop arms flows through Syria), and discussions about missiles and proxy restraint as part of a broader follow-on agreement. In essence, Scenario 2 envisions the conflict de-escalating into a **diplomatic endgame**, much like how intense confrontations in the past (e.g., the Cuban Missile Crisis) led to negotiated settlements once each side realized the costs of further escalation.

**Key Variables:** The highest variable here is **political will and mediation**. If the U.S. and possibly Europe can present Iran’s leadership with a viable face-saving off-ramp – one that guarantees regime survival and some economic relief – Iran may opt for it over continued punishment. The rhetoric from Washington suggests this is the intent; Trump’s statement that it’s “not too late” for a deal indicates the door is open for diplomacy. The unity (or lack thereof) among great powers matters: if **Russia and China back a new deal framework**, Iran would be more likely to accept it, as those partners could sweeten the pot (perhaps Russia offering to take Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile, as was floated, or China promising investments once sanctions ease). On the Israeli side, a variable is **Israeli confidence in partial measures**. Israel will only halt its campaign if it believes the outcome genuinely neutralizes the threat. A long-term deal or even an interim one must have teeth – likely far stricter than the original JCPOA – for Israel to consider it a win. If Israel’s intelligence indicates that enough of Iran’s program was destroyed that Iran would need years to rebuild, Israel might feel comfortable pausing and letting diplomacy play out. Another factor is **Iran’s regime calculus**: Khamenei’s foremost concern is regime survival. If he perceives that continued fighting risks internal collapse or invites overwhelming U.S. force, he may authorize negotiators to strike a deal. Already, Iranian officials know they were given a **June 2025 deadline by Europe** for a new accord – that moment has arrived in fire, perhaps making clear that no deal means war. That recognition could tip the balance. Domestic public opinion in each country also shapes this: in Israel, there will be a rally-around-the-flag effect but also fear of prolonged war; if the government can say “we achieved our goals,” Israelis would accept stopping short of regime change. In Iran, after an initial burst of anger, people suffering economic hardship may prefer a return to negotiations if it means avoiding further devastation. **Historical precedent** is another variable: Iran’s leadership might draw lessons from e.g. the Iran-Iraq War (when Khomeini drank the “poisoned chalice” of a truce when survival was at stake) – thus they might similarly choose a painful compromise now. The presence of **ongoing backchannels** (via Oman or Switzerland) will facilitate communications to prevent misunderstandings and allow for incremental de-escalation steps, like Iran quietly standing down its forces if Israel halts strikes, and the U.S. subtly pausing new sanctions as a gesture. This scenario’s probability is rated high because *all principal actors have something to gain*: Israel removes the imminent nuclear threat, the U.S. avoids a quagmire and possibly secures a non-proliferation win, and Iran’s regime gets to live another day (with its survival assured and perhaps some sanctions relief to ease popular discontent). It essentially aligns with what Israel’s National Security Council hinted: military action to **“create conditions for a long-term deal”**. The main risk is whether trust can be built given the bile and bloodshed. The variables – especially timely mediation and guarantees of enforcement – will determine if this scenario comes to fruition.

### Scenario 3: **Internal Upheaval and Regime Change in Iran** (Probability: *Low*)

In this scenario, the cumulative pressure of Israel’s strikes and Iran’s weakened state leads to a sudden political upheaval within Iran – potentially even the collapse or fundamental change of the Islamic Republic regime. The Israeli attack has clearly shaken the Iranian elite; one regional official observed that Iran’s rulers have been *“shaken to the core”* and panic is rising about their eroding grip on power. Scenario 3 posits that this panic materializes into a **major internal crisis**: mass protests erupt in multiple Iranian cities, fueled by public anger at the regime’s inability to protect the country and longstanding grievances over economic mismanagement, corruption, and repression. Unlike past protest waves, this time the unrest might reach a critical mass. Perhaps elements of Iran’s security forces – seeing the writing on the wall – splinter away; for instance, some military units or provincial IRGC commanders might refuse orders to fire on crowds, or a coalition of senior figures (possibly including a moderate ex-official or disaffected Revolutionary Guard officers) might move to oust the Supreme Leader or force significant changes. The chaos of war, combined with decades of internal dissent, could thus trigger either a **palace coup** or a **revolutionary uprising**. If regime change were to occur, it might take one of several forms: a replacement of Khamenei (who is aging and rumored to have health issues) with a council or a less hardline figure who immediately seeks peace; the outright toppling of the theocratic system with a provisional government forming (though that is a very complex, violent process likely); or even fragmentation where different regions or factions carve out control in a quasi-civil war scenario. For Israel and the U.S., while they officially claim not to be seeking to conquer Iran, many would view a change in Tehran’s regime as an ultimate strategic victory – Netanyahu’s messaging to Iranians that *“the day of your liberation is near”* hints that regime collapse is indeed a hoped-for outcome. If a new government emerged in Iran, presumably more moderate or at least anxious to rebuild, it could swiftly agree to halt any nuclear weapons ambitions and seek international support, effectively ending the conflict. Israel would have achieved through indirect means (regime implosion) what it ultimately desired in terms of security. However, regime change could also yield **volatile and unpredictable results**: a power vacuum in Iran might lead to violent infighting, refugee flows, and unsecured military assets (including missiles or nuclear materials) – effectively a scenario of a destabilized Iran.

**Key Variables:** The trigger for this scenario is **Iran’s internal cohesion** (or loss thereof). A critical variable is the **Iranian public’s response** to the crisis. If large swathes of the population who were already discontent – women, younger Iranians, ethnic minorities like Kurds and Baluchis – seize this moment to protest or rebel, the sheer scale could overwhelm Iran’s security forces. Already, years of sanctions and misrule have made Iran’s economy fragile; the new shock of strikes will exacerbate inflation and perhaps cause shortages (if panic leads to runs on banks or hoarding of food/fuel). This economic stress can fan unrest. Another variable is the **morale and unity of the security apparatus**. The IRGC has been the regime’s backbone, but the death of its top commander (Salami) and others in one night is a severe blow. If the remaining leadership (like the newly elevated Pakpour) fail to control the narrative or if junior IRGC officers feel the leadership has led them into ruin, cracks could form. We could see defections or at least hesitancy to carry out draconian orders. The regular Artesh (Iran’s conventional army) might also assert itself if it views the clerical rulers as having endangered Iran – it’s not impossible that elements of the military could side with protestors or push for the clerics to step aside, in a nationalist “save the nation” move. A variable influencing security force loyalty is **communications and propaganda**: if Iran’s information blackout falters and people see Israeli messages or opposition broadcasts encouraging uprising, it could embolden them. Conversely, if the regime can keep a tight grip on information (blaming all woes solely on Israel/US and portraying any dissent as treason), it might hold its ranks together. The **role of opposition groups and exiles** also factors in. Iran has organized dissidents abroad (like the son of the former Shah, or groups like MEK – though MEK is widely reviled internally) who may try to take advantage by calling for revolution or even infiltrating activists. Should a charismatic opposition figure emerge (either inside Iran, such as a senior cleric breaking ranks, or outside, like an exiled leader returning), it could galvanize a movement. International players would influence this too: the U.S. and Europe might encourage a softer coup (perhaps preferring an internal change to a secular government that will renounce nukes) but will be wary of chaos. They might quietly communicate to some Iranian insiders that if they remove Khamenei and stop aggression, Iran will get aid and legitimacy. **Historical memory** is another variable – Iran’s leaders remember that internal unrest during war (like in the 1980s) nearly unraveled them, and also how the Shah’s regime fell in 1979 when the army eventually refused to shoot protestors. Those lessons might make the Supreme Leader extremely paranoid and prone to overreact (which could ironically accelerate collapse if too much force is used). Given how entrenched the Islamic Republic’s security apparatus is, and its willingness historically to massacre its own people to stay in power, the probability of regime change is relatively low in the near term. Yet the events unleashed now make it a distinct possibility on the horizon. If Iran’s regime were a chair, Israel has sawed off a couple of legs (military prestige, economic stability); whether the chair falls depends on the remaining legs (ideological control, security service loyalty) holding. In summary, while Scenario 3 is less likely than a negotiated de-escalation, its consequences would be far-reaching – potentially resolving the nuclear issue if a friendlier Iran emerges, but also opening a Pandora’s box of uncertainty during any transitional chaos.

## Most Likely Outcome

Of the scenarios outlined, the **most probable outcome is Scenario 2: a contained conflict that paves the way for renewed diplomatic resolution** of the Iran nuclear issue. This assessment is based on the balance of capabilities and interests at play as well as initial indicators from the aftermath of the June 13 strikes.

Israel’s Operation Rising Lion achieved a strategic surprise and delivered a heavy blow to Iran’s nuclear program and military leadership, but Israeli officials themselves acknowledge that *completely* destroying Iran’s nuclear capacity is beyond Israel’s unilateral reach. Therefore, it serves Israel’s interests to **leverage this success into a lasting solution** – ideally, an agreement that forces Iran to dismantle remaining nuclear activities under international supervision. The Israeli leadership appears to be calibrating its campaign to avoid an open-ended quagmire; Netanyahu’s government has signaled openness to halting further strikes if the “existential threat” is neutralized. This implies Israel would welcome a scenario where Iran, reeling from the attack, opts to concede key nuclear demands through negotiations rather than continue absorbing blows. Indeed, Israeli officials explicitly note that without U.S. partnership, some of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure may endure, meaning Israel likely *needs* a diplomatic endgame (involving the U.S. and IAEA) to finish the task.

On the Iranian side, despite belligerent rhetoric, the regime’s rational core interest is **self-preservation**. A full war with Israel and the United States would put the regime’s survival in grave jeopardy – a point even Iran’s leadership likely recognizes. Tehran’s initial retaliation was symbolically fierce but ultimately limited in effect, suggesting a reluctance to escalate to a point of no return. The fact that Iran resorted to the UN and is engaging diplomatically (even if only to condemn Israel) shows it has *not* slammed the door on political paths. Iran’s leaders have endured decades of sanctions and pressure; they are adept at walking up to red lines and then retreating when the cost becomes too high. The **shock and awe** of losing key military assets might incline them to seek a timeout and regroup. Iran might privately agree to freeze enrichment and accept rigorous inspections (essentially what the U.S. had been proposing) in exchange for a ceasefire – an outcome broadly aligning with Scenario 2. Notably, President Trump’s continued emphasis that a deal is possible and his refrain “Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left” underscores that Washington is poised to broker such a settlement rather than pursue regime destruction.

The international community’s reactions also tilt toward containing the conflict and resolving it diplomatically. There is little appetite globally for a multi-front Middle East war. The European powers and even China/Russia (despite their differing sympathies) are likely urging de-escalation. This creates a conducive environment for backchannel negotiations and a compromise – perhaps an updated nuclear accord – to emerge once both sides have demonstrated their mettle. A telling sign is that Israel named the first wave **“the start of a prolonged operation”**, but it has not yet followed up with unlimited aggression; it seems poised to see what Iran does next. If Iran’s retaliation remains limited (as it has so far aside from the missile volley), Israel may hold off further strikes, effectively creating space for talks.

In contrast, Scenario 1 (full regional war) is less likely because it offers **no controllable upside** for either Israel or Iran. Both sides know a larger war would be devastating: Iran could be crushed militarily, and Israel could suffer unprecedented civilian destruction. Both will try to avoid crossing the threshold that triggers that catastrophe. Scenario 3 (regime change in Iran), while possibly a welcome outcome for Israel, is not something that can be guaranteed or achieved in the short term without immense unpredictability. Betting on a regime collapse is risky and not a strategy one can count on; Israel’s immediate goals are better served by a concrete deal that curtails the nuclear threat now. Moreover, should Iran’s regime start to destabilize, Israel and the U.S. might actually pause to avoid chaos that could let loose nuclear materials – ironically, they might prefer a weakened but intact regime signing a deal over a violent collapse scenario.

Therefore, the most likely trajectory is that after a brief, intense exchange, **all parties pivot to diplomacy under coerced conditions**. We are likely to see, in the coming days/weeks, quiet negotiations possibly mediated by Oman or Qatar, where Iran agrees to stringent limitations on its nuclear program (far beyond its previous stance) in order to stave off further Israeli strikes and U.S. military action. Israel, having made its point, will consent to a halt in operations as long as the agreed terms are being implemented. The United States will play the guarantor role, likely orchestrating a new understanding that could involve multinational monitoring and perhaps elements of a broader regional security framework to reassure Israel. In essence, **the conflict will conclude not with Tehran’s capitulation on the battlefield, but at the negotiating table**, under the shadow of Israel’s demonstrated military might.

One can envision a scenario where, by late 2025, Iran and the P5+1 (UN Security Council powers and Germany) announce a new accord: Iran dismantles damaged nuclear infrastructure and exports its enriched uranium (maybe to Russia as proposed), the UN snapback sanctions remain in place or even tighten until verification is complete, and Israel pauses its “Rising Lion” operation. While hardliners on both sides will grumble – Iranian hawks against “surrender” and Israeli hawks skeptical of Iran’s word – the reality of the power dynamics post-June 13 favors a diplomatic solution. As a Reuters analysis succinctly put it, *“Analysts said \[President] Trump could leverage the fallout from the Israeli strikes to bring Iran back to the negotiating table – but this time more isolated, and more likely to offer deeper concessions.”* This is precisely the likely outcome: a chastened Iran coming to terms with constraints it once deemed unacceptable, because the alternative is an unwinnable war and possibly the regime’s end.

In conclusion, the **most likely outcome** is that the current conflict, rather than spiraling into all-out war or revolution, will *force a recalibration* of Iran’s behavior through a mix of military pressure and diplomatic outreach. A high-impact, but relatively contained conflict will give way to a tense peace – one secured not by trust, but by robust verification and the lingering threat that Israel (with U.S. support) could strike again if Iran reneges. Such an outcome would temporarily defuse the crisis and achieve the primary objectives of Israel and the international community: preventing a nuclear-armed Iran and restoring a measure of stability to a volatile region, at least for the foreseeable future.
