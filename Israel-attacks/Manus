## 2. STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT

### Israeli Objectives and Constraints

**Objectives:**

- **Contain Iran's nuclear program:** Israel views Iran's nuclear program as an existential threat. Its actions aim to degrade Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities and destroy key facilities like Natanz. (Source: Euronews, BBC, EFE)
- **Degrade Iran's missile and drone capabilities:** Israel seeks to neutralize the threat posed by Iranian ballistic missiles and drones, which can be used directly against Israel or transferred to proxy groups. Recent attacks have targeted missile factories and depots. (Source: Euronews, DW)
- **Neutralize Iran's regional influence and proxies:** Israel seeks to weaken Iran's network of proxies (such as Hamas and Hezbollah) and their ability to operate in the region. The assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders, as well as attacks on Iranian facilities in Syria, are examples of this strategy. (Source: AP News)
- **Deter future attacks:** Through military and covert actions, Israel seeks to establish credible deterrence against Iran, demonstrating its capability and willingness to act in self-defense. (Source: Based on pattern analysis)
- **Decapitate military and scientific leadership:** Recent attacks have targeted high-ranking Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists, seeking to disorganize and weaken Iran's decision-making and strategic capability development. (Source: Euronews, BBC)

**Constraints:**

- **Risk of escalation to all-out war:** The main constraint for Israel is to avoid a large-scale war with Iran, which could further destabilize the region and have unpredictable consequences. Every Israeli military action must carefully weigh the potential Iranian response and the risk of uncontrollable escalation. (Source: DW, Milenio)
- **International pressure:** Israel faces pressure from the international community, including its allies like the United States, to avoid further escalation. This may limit the scope and frequency of its operations. (Source: CNN, AP News)
- **Iran's retaliation capability:** Iran has demonstrated its ability to launch missile and drone attacks directly against Israel, posing a significant threat to Israeli security. The need to maintain defense capabilities and minimize damage is a constant constraint. (Source: AP News, CNN)
- **Complexity of covert operations:** While effective, covert operations carry risks of exposure, retaliation, and potential errors that could have unintended diplomatic or military consequences. (Source: Euronews)
- **Economic impact:** A large-scale conflict could have a significant economic impact on Israel, affecting trade, investment, and financial stability. (Source: CNN)

### Iranian Response Doctrine and Capabilities

**Response Doctrine:**

- **Asymmetric and gradual response:** Iran has historically employed an asymmetric response doctrine, using a combination of direct attacks (missiles and drones), covert operations, and the use of regional proxies to respond to Israeli actions. The intensity of the response is often gradual, seeking to avoid total escalation while sending a deterrent message. (Source: Based on pattern analysis, AP News)
- **Emphasis on deterrence:** The Iranian doctrine seeks to deter Israel from future attacks by demonstrating Iran's ability to inflict damage. The response to recent attacks with hundreds of missiles and drones is an example of this strategy. (Source: AP News, CNN)
- **Protection of the nuclear program:** Iran considers its nuclear program a pillar of its national security. Any attack on its nuclear facilities or scientists is seen as a red line that justifies a strong response. (Source: Euronews, BBC)
- **Revenge for assassinations:** Iran has promised and carried out retaliations for the assassination of its nuclear scientists and military leaders, indicating an "eye for an eye" policy in certain contexts. (Source: AP News)
- **No waiting for international approval:** Iran has stated that it will not wait for the international community's approval to respond to Israeli attacks, underscoring its autonomy in security decision-making. (Source: Le Grand Continent)

**Capabilities:**

- **Nuclear program:** Iran has been enriching uranium to near-weapons-grade levels (60%), which would theoretically allow it to reach the 90% needed for a nuclear weapon in a short time. Although Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons, its enrichment capability is a central concern for Israel and the international community. (Source: AP News, Euronews)
- **Ballistic missiles:** Iran possesses a vast arsenal of short, medium, and long-range ballistic missiles capable of reaching targets in Israel and throughout the region. It has invested significantly in the development of these systems since the Iran-Iraq war. (Source: La Prensa NI, Cenital)
- **Drones:** Iran has developed sophisticated drone capabilities, including attack and reconnaissance drones. These drones have been used in direct attacks against Israel and by its proxies in the region. (Source: La Prensa NI, Infobae)
- **Proxy forces:** Iran supports and arms a network of armed groups in the region, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and militias in Iraq and Syria. These proxies act as an extension of Iranian power and can be used to launch attacks against Israel or its interests. (Source: AP News)
- **Cyber capabilities:** Iran has demonstrated significant capabilities in cyber warfare, conducting attacks against critical infrastructure and military systems. (Source: Based on pattern analysis)

### Key Stakeholder Positions

**United States:**

- **Support for Israel's security:** The United States is a key ally of Israel and has reiterated its commitment to Israel's security, including its right to self-defense. This has been demonstrated by assistance in intercepting Iranian missiles. (Source: CNN, AP News)
- **Avoid regional escalation:** Despite its support for Israel, the United States seeks to avoid a major escalation that could destabilize the region and draw US forces into a direct conflict. There have been statements of disengagement from Israeli attacks and warnings against attacks on US interests. (Source: YouTube - Informe desde Washington, Telemundo 47, El Orden Mundial)
- **Concern about Iran's nuclear program:** The United States shares Israel's concern about Iran's nuclear program and has sought, through diplomacy and sanctions, to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. However, there have been differences in approach, with some in the US preferring negotiation over direct military action. (Source: NYT, Infobae)
- **Managing the relationship with Iran:** US policy toward Iran is complex, seeking to contain its malign influence in the region while keeping open the possibility of a nuclear deal. Recent tensions have led Iran to withdraw from nuclear talks with the US. (Source: YouTube - Irán da un golpe en la mesa)

**Russia:**

- **Condemnation of Israeli attacks:** Russia has condemned the bombings launched by Israel against Iran, according to Kremlin reports. (Source: DW, YouTube - LAS NOTICIAS)
- **Concern about escalation:** Russia has expressed concern about the escalation of tensions, warning about the threat of a nuclear conflict. (Source: YouTube - Rusia tras el ataque de Israel a Irán)
- **Implicit support for Iran:** Some analysts suggest that Russia, along with China, could support Iran in its response to Israeli attacks, given the growing cooperation between these countries. (Source: YouTube - VILLARROYA)
- **Geopolitical interests:** Russia has strategic interests in the Middle East, including its relationship with Iran and its desire to counter Western influence in the region. An escalation could force Russia to redefine its positions. (Source: Radio UChile)

**Gulf States (e.g., Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates):**

- **Concern about regional stability:** Gulf states, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are deeply concerned about the escalation of tensions between Israel and Iran, as a large-scale conflict could have devastating consequences for the region's stability and security. (Source: Radio UChile, Koha.mk)
- **Economic interests:** The Gulf region is a key player in the global energy market. Any disruption in oil or gas supply due to a conflict could have a significant economic impact on these states. (Source: DW, Yahoo Noticias)
- **Complex relations with Iran:** Although they have historically had tense relations with Iran, some Gulf states have recently sought avenues for dialogue and de-escalation with Tehran. However, the threat of Iran's nuclear program and its support for regional proxies remains a concern. (Source: Based on pattern analysis)
- **Dependence on US security:** Many Gulf states rely on the US military presence and support for their security, which influences their stance on the conflict. (Source: YouTube - Israel prepara un ataque inminente)

### Information Gaps and Contested Narratives

- **Verification of attacks and damages:** Information on the actual extent of attacks, casualties, and damage inflicted on facilities is often difficult to verify independently. Both sides may have incentives to exaggerate or minimize results. (Assessment: This is common in conflicts where information is a tool of psychological and political warfare.)
- **Attribution of covert operations:** Covert operations, such as assassinations of scientists or sabotage, are rarely officially claimed, leading to speculation and contradictory narratives about authorship. (Assessment: The secret nature of these operations makes confirmation difficult.)
- **Actual state of Iran's nuclear program:** Although there are estimates of Iran's uranium enrichment level, the exact state of its nuclear program and its ability to develop a nuclear weapon is a subject of constant debate and speculation. (Assessment: The opacity of the Iranian program and the lack of full access for international inspectors contribute to this gap.)
- **Long-term intentions:** The long-term strategic intentions of both countries are subject to diverse interpretations. Does Iran truly seek a nuclear weapon? What is the limit of Israel's "red line"? These questions often lack definitive answers and are shaped by the narratives of each actor. (Assessment: Intentions can change over time and are subject to the evolving geopolitical situation.)
- **Influence of non-state actors:** The degree of control and autonomy of Iran-backed proxy groups (such as Hamas and Hezbollah) is often debated, making it difficult to assess the chain of command and responsibility in certain incidents. (Assessment: The dynamic between Iran and its proxies is complex and not always linear.)

## 3. SCENARIO FORECASTING

### Scenario A: Controlled Escalation and Intensified Shadow War

- **Triggers:**
    - Continued and selective Israeli attacks against Iranian military or nuclear targets, without causing mass casualties or catastrophic damage.
    - Measured Iranian responses, using missiles and drones, or through proxies, but avoiding a large-scale direct attack that would provoke a devastating Israeli response.
    - Constant international pressure for de-escalation, with diplomatic efforts to contain the conflict.
    - Failure in nuclear negotiations, but without a total withdrawal of Iran from the NPT or rapid progress towards nuclear armament.
- **Probability:** Medium-High. (Assessment: This scenario reflects the historical pattern of confrontation between Israel and Iran, where both actors seek to inflict damage and deter each other without triggering an all-out war that neither can afford.)
- **Indicators to watch:**
    - Frequency and precision of Israeli attacks: Do they remain surgical or become more indiscriminate?
    - Nature of Iranian retaliations: Are they proportional and symbolic, or do they seek to inflict significant damage?
    - Public statements by leaders of both countries: Do they remain in a warning tone or become more belligerent?
    - Activity of Iranian proxies in the region: Do their attacks increase or remain at a manageable level?
    - Diplomatic efforts and international mediation: Is there progress in de-escalation or do they stagnate?
    - Troop movements and military deployments: Are there significant force buildups in the region?

### Scenario B: Uncontrolled Escalation and Open Regional Conflict

- **Triggers:**
    - An Israeli attack that causes catastrophic damage to an Iranian nuclear facility or a very high number of civilian/high-ranking military casualties, which Iran deems unacceptable.
    - A massive and successful Iranian retaliation against strategic targets in Israel, overwhelming Israeli defense capabilities and causing significant damage.
    - A miscalculation or unintentional action that triggers an uncontrollable chain of events.
    - The direct intervention of an external actor (e.g., US or Russia) that alters the balance of power and provokes an aggressive response from the opposing side.
    - The total collapse of nuclear negotiations and an Iranian announcement of seeking nuclear weapons, leading to a large-scale preemptive military action by Israel.
- **Probability:** Medium. (Assessment: Although both sides seek to avoid an all-out war, the risk of miscalculation or unintentional escalation is significant, especially given the frequency and intensity of recent attacks. The "shadow war" has the potential to spill over.)
- **Indicators to watch:**
    - Drastic increase in belligerent rhetoric from both sides, with explicit threats of all-out war.
    - Large-scale mobilization of military forces and reserves in both countries.
    - Attacks on civilian or energy infrastructure of either country.
    - Significant disruption of maritime traffic in the Strait of Hormuz.
    - Withdrawal of diplomatic personnel and travel warnings to citizens by third countries.
    - Coordinated and large-scale attacks by Iranian proxies against Israel from multiple fronts.

### Scenario C: De-escalation and Negotiation

- **Triggers:**
    - A clear signal from both sides of willingness to de-escalate, possibly through indirect diplomatic channels.
    - Successful mediation efforts by third countries (e.g., Oman, Qatar, the European Union) that facilitate dialogue.
    - A renewed commitment to diplomatic solutions for Iran's nuclear program, perhaps with a new agreement or a return to negotiations.
    - Internal political changes in either country that favor a less confrontational approach.
    - A significant external event (e.g., a global economic crisis, a new regional threat) that diverts attention and priorities of both countries from the mutual conflict.
- **Probability:** Low-Medium. (Assessment: Given the current intensity of tensions and deep mutual distrust, rapid de-escalation seems unlikely in the short term. However, the potential costs of a large-scale conflict could eventually push both sides towards negotiation.)
- **Indicators to watch:**
    - Notable reduction in the frequency and severity of military and covert attacks.
    - Public statements by leaders of both countries emphasizing diplomacy and peaceful resolution.
    - Resumption of direct or indirect talks between Israel and Iran, or between Iran and Western powers on the nuclear program.
    - Significant progress in negotiations on Iran's nuclear program, such as the implementation of new safeguards or restrictions.
    - Decreased activity of Iranian proxies in the region, or a change in their modus operandi.
    - High-level visits by international mediators to Tehran and Tel Aviv.

## 4. MOST LIKELY TRAJECTORY

### Selected Scenario: Controlled Escalation and Intensified Shadow War (Scenario A)

**Evidence-Based Justification:**

 The most likely trajectory of tensions between Israel and Iran is a continuation and deepening of the "shadow war" and controlled escalation. This assessment is based on several factors:

1.  **Historical Pattern:** The relationship between Israel and Iran over the last decade has been characterized by selective attacks, covert operations, and the use of proxies, rather than a large-scale direct military confrontation. Both countries have demonstrated a clear preference for avoiding an all-out war, recognizing the catastrophic costs it would entail. Recent incidents, although intense, have followed this pattern of measured retaliation and specific objectives, as observed in the incident timeline. (Based on pattern analysis)
2.  **Strategic Objectives and Mutual Constraints:** Both Israel and Iran have clear strategic objectives (nuclear containment for Israel, deterrence and power projection for Iran), but also operate under significant constraints. Israel seeks to degrade Iranian capabilities without provoking a disproportionate response that would drag the region into an open conflict. Iran, for its part, seeks to deter Israel and avenge attacks without crossing a line that would invite an invasion or a massive attack on its vital infrastructure. (Assessment: Mutual constraints act as a brake on uncontrolled escalation.)
3.  **Role of Key Actors:** The United States, while an ally of Israel, has expressed its desire to avoid regional escalation and has sought to disassociate itself from Israel's more aggressive attacks, suggesting a limit to unconditional support in the event of an all-out war. Russia and the Gulf states also have interests in regional stability and will likely exert pressure to contain the conflict. (Assessment: International pressure, although not always effective, helps keep escalation within certain limits.)
4.  **Nature of Recent Attacks:** The Israeli attacks on June 13, 2025, although significant, targeted specific military and nuclear objectives, and the Iranian response, although massive in terms of projectiles, was largely intercepted and did not cause catastrophic damage, suggesting an intention to send a message without triggering an all-out war. (Source: CNN, AP News)

**Key Assumptions:**

-   **Rationality of Actors:** It is assumed that both Israel and Iran, despite their belligerent rhetoric, will act rationally to protect their national interests and avoid actions that would jeopardize their existence or cause irreparable damage to their economies and societies.
-   **Maintenance of Indirect Communication Channels:** Although there is no direct dialogue, it is assumed that indirect channels exist (through third countries or intelligence) that allow both sides to communicate "red lines" and avoid catastrophic misunderstandings.
-   **Continuity of International Pressure:** It is assumed that the international community, led by the United States, will continue to exert diplomatic pressure to contain the escalation and seek negotiated solutions, especially with regard to Iran's nuclear program.
-   **Absence of a Major "Black Swan" Event:** It is assumed that no unforeseen event of great magnitude (a "black swan") will occur that drastically alters the balance of power or the intentions of the actors, forcing an uncontrolled escalation.

**Wildcards:**

-   **Miscalculation or Accident:** A technical error, intelligence failure, or unintentional accident during a military or covert operation could trigger an uncontrollable chain of retaliations.
-   **Change in Leadership or Doctrine:** A change in political or military leadership in Israel or Iran could lead to a more aggressive or less cautious doctrine, increasing the risk of direct confrontation.
-   **Accelerated Iranian Nuclear Advance:** If Iran decides to drastically accelerate its nuclear program and approaches nuclear weapons capability, Israel could be forced into a large-scale preemptive military action, which could trigger an all-out war.
-   **Direct Intervention of a Third Actor:** The direct military intervention of an external power (e.g., US or Russia) in support of one of the sides could alter the balance and lead to regional escalation.
-   **Collapse of Regional Stability:** A widespread collapse of stability in the region (e.g., a civil war in a neighboring country, a massive terrorist attack) could create a power vacuum or a perceived opportunity for one of the parties, leading to more aggressive action.

**Timeline Estimate:**

This trajectory of "controlled escalation and intensified shadow war" is expected to continue in the **medium term (12-24 months)**. We are likely to see:

-   **Continued selective attacks:** Israel will continue to carry out covert operations and selective airstrikes against Iranian targets related to its nuclear program, missile and drone capabilities, and proxy networks.
-   **Measured Iranian retaliations:** Iran will respond to these attacks with a combination of missiles and drones, and through its proxies, seeking to inflict damage and maintain deterrence without provoking an all-out war.
-   **Elevated but manageable tensions:** Rhetoric will often be belligerent, but actions will remain below the threshold of a large-scale open war.
-   **Intermittent diplomatic efforts:** There will be intermittent attempts at mediation and negotiation, especially regarding Iran's nuclear program, although a comprehensive agreement is unlikely in the short term.
-   **Constant risk of miscalculation:** The risk of uncontrolled escalation due to miscalculation or unintentional incident will remain high.

In summary, the current situation is one of precarious balance, where both actors are engaged in a dangerous dance of deterrence and limited confrontation. While an all-out war is a possibility, the most likely trajectory is a continuation of this "shadow war" with peaks of tension and retaliation, but without an open and sustained confrontation.
