The Shifting Sands: An Analysis of the Escalating Israel-Iran Conflict and Future Trajectories


I. Executive Summary

The long-simmering conflict between Israel and the Islamic Republic of Iran has transitioned into a phase of overt and increasingly perilous direct confrontation. Over the past six to eight months, a distinct escalation has been observed, moving beyond the traditional confines of proxy warfare and covert operations into direct state-on-state military exchanges. This culminated in extensive Israeli military actions against targets deep within Iran in June 2025, reportedly codenamed "Operation Rising Lion".1 These operations, targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, military installations, and key scientific and military personnel 1, signify a critical juncture.
Israel's motivations appear multifaceted, rooted primarily in its long-standing determination to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons capabilities, a stance often referred to as the Begin Doctrine.5 Beyond counter-proliferation, the recent Israeli operations suggest a broader strategy aimed at systemically degrading Iran's conventional military power, disrupting its command and control, and potentially fostering internal instability within the Islamic Republic.6 This represents a significant strategic gamble, intended to re-establish deterrence and roll back perceived Iranian threats to Israeli security.1
Iran's response has been a complex balancing act. While demonstrating a willingness to retaliate directly for attacks on its sovereignty and key assets – as seen in its missile and drone launches in April 2024 and its drone response in June 2025 8 – Tehran's overarching strategic imperative remains regime survival.10 This necessitates a degree of calibration in its responses to avoid a full-scale conflagration that it is ill-equipped to win against a technologically superior Israel, particularly with potential United States involvement.
The United States occupies a pivotal and complex position, publicly distancing itself from direct involvement in Israel's June 2025 offensive while simultaneously reaffirming its commitment to Israeli security and issuing warnings to Iran against targeting U.S. interests.11 Washington's efforts are geared towards supporting its key ally and deterring Iranian aggression, yet concurrently aiming to prevent an uncontrollable escalation into a wider regional war with devastating economic and geopolitical consequences.
This report analyzes the timeline of these escalations, delves into the strategic motivations of Israel and Iran, assesses Iranian capabilities and responses, examines the roles of key international and regional actors, and explores competing interpretations of events. Based on this analysis, three potential future scenarios are posited: Protracted Controlled Escalation, Major Regional Conflagration, and De-escalation and Tenuous Stalemate. The most probable trajectory is assessed to be a state of Protracted Controlled Escalation, characterized by continued, calculated hostilities below the threshold of all-out war, yet fraught with the persistent risk of miscalculation and further escalation. This new phase of direct engagement has fundamentally altered the conflict's dynamics, heightening regional instability and posing significant challenges to international peace and security.

II. Timeline of Key Incidents (December 2023 - June 2025)

The period from late 2023 through mid-2025 has witnessed a significant intensification of hostilities between Israel and Iran, moving from a "shadow war" characterized by covert actions and proxy engagements to direct military confrontations. The following timeline details key incidents, with a particular focus on the escalatory cycle leading up to and including the major Israeli operations in June 2025. This sequence of events underscores a pattern of reciprocal actions, where each response has often sought not merely to retaliate but to achieve broader strategic aims, thereby pushing the conflict into progressively more dangerous territory. The targeting choices, from key Iranian military figures and proxy leaders to critical infrastructure and, ultimately, large-scale attacks on Iranian soil, suggest a systematic Israeli effort to dismantle Iran's regional influence architecture while directly addressing threats emanating from Iran itself.

This timeline illustrates not only an increase in the frequency and intensity of direct engagements but also a broadening of target sets. The assassinations of high-profile figures like Mousavi, Zahedi, Haniyeh, and Nasrallah demonstrate a concerted effort to degrade the leadership and operational capabilities of Iran and its allied militant groups.3 Iran's direct missile and drone barrages in April and October 2024 marked its own willingness to cross previous thresholds in response to Israeli actions.8 The Israeli operation in June 2025, however, represents a new peak in this escalatory cycle, with overt, large-scale attacks on strategic assets within Iranian territory, explicitly aimed at its nuclear and military infrastructure.1

III. Deep Research and Analysis

The current phase of the Israel-Iran conflict is driven by a complex interplay of deeply entrenched strategic motivations, evolving military capabilities, and the influence of regional and international actors. The direct confrontations witnessed in 2024 and culminating in the June 2025 Israeli offensive reflect a mutual reassessment of red lines and acceptable costs by both nations.

A. Strategic Motivations and Objectives

Israel's Rationale:
Israel's strategic posture towards Iran is fundamentally shaped by the perception of an existential threat, particularly from Iran's nuclear ambitions. This has led to a proactive and often preemptive security doctrine.
Preventing a Nuclear Iran (The Begin Doctrine): The cornerstone of Israeli strategy is the prevention of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. This is a direct application of the "Begin Doctrine," first articulated in 1981, which posits that Israel will not permit an enemy to develop weapons of mass destruction that could threaten its existence and will act preemptively if necessary.5 Israeli officials have repeatedly framed Iran's nuclear program as approaching a "point of no return," justifying actions like "Operation Rising Lion" as essential to national survival.1 The IDF's assertion that Iran was advancing a "secret plan" for its nuclear program, even during negotiations with the U.S., further fueled this urgency.7
Degrading Conventional Military and Proxy Capabilities: Beyond the nuclear threat, Israel aims to curtail Iran's conventional military power and its ability to project influence through its network of regional proxies, often termed the "Axis of Resistance." Attacks on Iranian missile facilities, air defense systems, and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) assets serve this purpose.1 The targeted killings of senior Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut are integral to this strategy of weakening Iran's forward-deployed assets and allies.3
Re-establishing Deterrence: A key objective is to re-establish and reinforce deterrence against Iran. By demonstrating the capability and willingness to conduct complex, deep-penetration strikes with significant impact inside Iran, Israel seeks to dissuade Tehran from future aggression or further advancements in its nuclear program.6 The scale of the June 2025 operations was intended to send an unequivocal message.
Exploiting Perceived Windows of Opportunity: The timing of major Israeli operations may be influenced by a confluence of factors perceived as creating a favorable window. These could include assessments of temporarily weakened Iranian air defenses due to prior Israeli actions 15, perceived stagnation or unfavorable developments in U.S.-Iran nuclear diplomacy 14, and the political posture of key allies, notably the United States.7 Prime Minister Netanyahu reportedly judged that global circumstances were advantageous for the June 2025 strikes.18
Psychological Warfare and Regime Destabilization: There is an evident psychological dimension to Israeli strategy. Public messaging often aims to distinguish between the Iranian people and the regime, potentially hoping to exploit internal fissures and incite unrest by highlighting the regime's vulnerabilities and inability to protect its assets and personnel.6 The targeting of senior military and scientific leadership is also designed to disorient Iran's decision-making processes and create an environment of shock and disruption.6 This approach, reminiscent of tactics used in Lebanon, suggests an objective that may extend to degrading the stability of the Islamic Republic itself.6
Iran's Strategic Calculus:
Iran's strategic decision-making is primarily driven by the imperative of regime survival, coupled with ambitions for regional influence and the deterrence of external threats.
Regime Survival: The paramount goal of the Islamic Republic's leadership is the preservation of the regime.10 All strategic actions, including responses to Israeli attacks, are ultimately weighed against their potential impact on regime stability. This often leads to a degree of caution to avoid a full-scale war that could prove catastrophic.19
Deterrence (Primarily Asymmetric): Historically, Iran has relied on an asymmetric warfare doctrine to counter conventionally superior adversaries. This involves cultivating and supporting a network of proxy forces (such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, various militias in Iraq and Syria, and the Houthis in Yemen), developing a formidable arsenal of ballistic missiles and drones, and enhancing its cyber warfare capabilities.10 These tools allow Iran to project power, harass adversaries, and establish a deterrent posture at a lower cost than maintaining a large, advanced conventional military. However, the direct Israeli attacks on Iranian soil have compelled Tehran to increasingly consider and employ direct state-level retaliation to maintain credibility.
Retaliation and "Strategic Patience" (with evolving limits): Iran has often employed a policy described as "strategic patience," involving calculated and sometimes delayed responses to provocations. However, the increasing scale and directness of Israeli attacks, particularly those on its sovereign territory and high-value personnel, have tested the limits of this patience. To maintain deterrence and domestic legitimacy, Iran has found it necessary to respond more forcefully and directly, as seen in its missile and drone attacks on Israel in April and October 2024, and its drone response in June 2025.8
Nuclear Hedging and Ambition: Iran's pursuit of advanced nuclear capabilities is a central element of its long-term strategy. While Tehran officially maintains its program is for peaceful purposes 15, the capabilities it is developing are widely seen as providing a pathway to nuclear weapons, which would serve as an ultimate deterrent and significantly enhance its regional standing.10 Paradoxically, Israeli strikes aimed at thwarting this ambition may, according to some analyses, accelerate a clandestine dash towards weaponization as Iran perceives its conventional deterrents as insufficient.14
Countering Regional Isolation and Building Alliances: Faced with sustained pressure from Israel and the United States, Iran actively seeks to counter regional isolation. This includes diplomatic overtures, such as its rapprochement with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states 22, and the strengthening of strategic partnerships with global powers like Russia and China, which can offer economic, technological, and diplomatic support.20
The strategic collision arises from Israel's determination to neutralize what it perceives as an imminent existential threat and Iran's resolve to preserve its regime, project regional power, and develop what it views as essential deterrent capabilities. This dynamic has created an escalatory spiral where each side's defensive moves are interpreted as offensive by the other, leading to a progressively more dangerous security dilemma.

B. Iranian Responses and Capabilities (Post-June 2025 Strikes)

The extensive Israeli military operations in June 2025 have undoubtedly impacted Iran's military and strategic posture, prompting immediate responses and raising critical questions about its remaining capabilities and future actions.
Immediate Military and Political Response:
In the immediate aftermath of the June 12-13 Israeli strikes, Iran launched a retaliatory barrage of approximately 100 drones towards Israel, though these were reportedly largely intercepted by Israeli and allied defenses.4 There were also reports of Iranian missile launches.1 Politically, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed revenge 9, and Iranian officials condemned the attacks as a violation of sovereignty and an act of aggression, highlighting alleged targeting of residential areas.24 Iran also suspended its participation in indirect nuclear talks with the United States, which were scheduled to resume shortly.7
Assessed Impact on Capabilities:
Nuclear Program: The Israeli strikes inflicted considerable damage, particularly at the Natanz enrichment facility. Satellite imagery confirmed extensive damage to the site's electrical power supply, including main and concealed transformer substations and backup generators, as well as the destruction of the above-ground Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant (PFEP).2 The PFEP reportedly housed over 1700 advanced centrifuges, including IR-6, IR-4, and IR-2m models.2 The deaths of several key Iranian nuclear scientists were also confirmed.1

However, the primary underground enrichment halls at Natanz appeared not to have been directly targeted with earth-penetrating munitions in this initial wave of attacks, nor did the new hardened facility under construction nearby at Mt. Kolang Gaz La show visible damage, though its power supply might be affected.2 Iran possesses other nuclear sites, such as Fordo and Isfahan (which was also reportedly struck 2), and retains the knowledge and likely some dispersed materials.13

Despite official Iranian defiance and claims that the nuclear program continues unabated 25, the damage, particularly to the PFEP and the loss of scientific expertise, represents a setback. A critical consequence, however, may be a strategic shift within Iran. Many analysts contend that such attacks, by exposing the vulnerability of its overt facilities, could paradoxically strengthen the arguments of hardliners advocating for an accelerated, clandestine sprint towards a deliverable nuclear weapon at more hardened, secret locations as the ultimate guarantor of security.13
Military Infrastructure and Retaliatory Capacity: The Israeli operation also targeted broader military infrastructure, including air defense systems, missile sites, and IRGC headquarters.1 The precise extent of degradation to Iran's overall retaliatory capacity remains a key uncertainty.26 While specific systems may have been damaged or destroyed, Iran maintains a substantial arsenal of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and drones, developed with the specific aim of targeting regional adversaries and U.S. bases.6 It also possesses significant anti-ship capabilities that could threaten maritime traffic in the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz.9 The effectiveness of these remaining assets, particularly in the face of advanced Israeli and allied defenses, is a critical factor in future calculations.
Proxy Network: Iran's "Axis of Resistance" has been a cornerstone of its regional power projection. However, this network has suffered significant blows with the elimination of key figures like Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas's Ismail Haniyeh in 2024.3 While groups like Hezbollah, the Houthis, and various Iraqi and Syrian militias retain considerable armaments and manpower, their willingness and capacity to engage in a full-scale war in direct support of Iran against Israel are subject to their own strategic calculations and vulnerabilities. Hezbollah, for instance, having recently concluded a damaging conflict with Israel, may be hesitant to fully re-engage.13 The June 2025 events may further test Iran's ability to effectively command, control, and coordinate these diverse proxy forces in a high-intensity conflict scenario.
Cyber Warfare: Cyber operations are an established component of the Israel-Iran conflict, with both sides possessing offensive and defensive capabilities. It is highly probable that cyberattacks will continue and potentially escalate as a means of retaliation and disruption, targeting critical infrastructure, government systems, and military networks.23
Internal Political and Social Impact:
The Israeli strikes have had a palpable impact within Iran. Reports indicate a mixture of public anger, fear, and frustration.7 Some citizens have reportedly questioned the regime's ability to protect the nation and its priorities, particularly the allocation of resources to foreign interventions and proxy groups versus domestic needs, especially in the absence of adequate civil defense measures like air raid sirens or shelters in some areas.7 The regime has responded with vows of retaliation and attempts to downplay the damage, while also reportedly imposing internet restrictions to control information flow.9

These events are likely to intensify internal debates within the Iranian establishment regarding the efficacy of its current security strategies and the sustainability of its confrontational foreign policy. While such crises can sometimes lead to a "rally around the flag" effect, the prevailing sentiment in initial reports suggests a deepening of existing societal fissures and discontent.7 The regime faces a dilemma: a failure to respond robustly could undermine its credibility among supporters and embolden adversaries, while a significant escalation carries existential risks. This internal pressure cooker adds another layer of complexity and unpredictability to Tehran's decision-making. The degradation of Iran's overt military and nuclear infrastructure may also compel Tehran to rely more heavily on its surviving asymmetric capabilities—such as its proxy network (however strained), cyber warfare, and a potential acceleration of covert nuclear activities—and to deepen its strategic partnerships with Russia and China for support and leverage.

C. The Role and Positioning of Key Actors

The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran is not occurring in a vacuum. It is profoundly influenced by, and in turn impacts, the policies and postures of key international and regional actors.
United States:
The United States plays a central, albeit complex, role in the Israel-Iran dynamic.
Official Stance and Diplomatic Actions: Washington publicly stated that Israel acted unilaterally in the June 2025 "Operation Rising Lion," and that the U.S. was not directly involved in the strikes.7 This was reiterated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who also issued a stern warning to Iran not to target U.S. interests or personnel in retaliation.11 Concurrently, President Donald Trump voiced strong support for Israel's actions, characterizing them as "excellent" and urging Iran to "make a deal, before there is nothing left," alluding to his administration's ongoing, though now stalled, efforts to negotiate a new nuclear agreement with Tehran.7 Prior to the June 2025 escalation, the Trump administration had reportedly discouraged an Israeli strike while these diplomatic talks were active.28 The strikes led Iran to suspend these negotiations indefinitely.7
Military Posture and Support for Israel: The U.S. maintains a significant military presence in the Middle East, which has been augmented in response to heightened tensions. This includes an expanded naval presence in the Gulf and fighter jet patrols to protect U.S. personnel and installations.9 Historically, and in the April 2024 Iranian missile attack, the U.S. played a crucial role in assisting Israel with missile and drone interceptions.8 The U.S. continues to be a primary supplier of advanced military equipment to Israel, and President Trump affirmed that more would be transferred.7
Strategic Dilemma: The U.S. is navigating a precarious balance. On one hand, there is an unwavering commitment to Israel's security and its right to self-defense.7 On the other, Washington is keen to prevent the conflict from spiraling into a wider regional war, which would endanger U.S. forces, destabilize key allies, disrupt global energy markets, and potentially draw the U.S. into direct military confrontation with Iran.7 This balancing act is increasingly challenging as Israeli actions become more assertive and Iranian responses more direct.
Russia and China:
Both Moscow and Beijing have significant strategic interests in the Middle East and view the escalating Israel-Iran conflict with concern, albeit through the lens of their broader geopolitical objectives.
Reaction to Escalation: Both Russia and China officially condemned the Israeli attacks in June 2025, expressed deep concern over the escalation, and called for restraint and de-escalation from all parties.31 They supported Iran's request for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council.31
Strategic Interests: A primary shared interest is the diminution of U.S. influence in the Middle East and the promotion of a more multipolar regional order.
Russia: Stands to benefit economically from instability in the Middle East that drives up global oil prices, which could alleviate pressure on its own sanctioned energy sector.32 Russia has deepening military-technical cooperation with Iran, including potential provision of advanced weaponry, intelligence, or cyber support, which could be amplified by the current conflict.20
China: As the world's largest oil importer, China has a vested interest in regional stability and the security of energy supplies from the Gulf.17 While calling for de-escalation, Beijing may also see opportunities to expand its economic and diplomatic footprint in a region where U.S. credibility or focus might be perceived as waning. China maintains significant economic ties with Iran.23

Their calls for restraint are likely genuine to the extent that they wish to avoid a catastrophic regional war, but the underlying strategic competition with the U.S. means they will also seek to leverage the crisis to their advantage.
European Union (and key member states: UK, France, Germany):
European powers are deeply concerned by the escalation and its potential ramifications.
Reaction and Diplomatic Stance: The EU and its leading member states have strongly urged maximum restraint and immediate de-escalation from both Israel and Iran.22 Some European statements have explicitly condemned Israeli aggression as a threat to regional peace and a derailment of diplomatic efforts to resolve Iran's nuclear crisis.22 There is significant concern for regional stability, the risks of nuclear proliferation, and the safety of international personnel, including IAEA inspectors in Iran.22
Proposed Diplomatic Strategy: European diplomatic efforts are focused on coordinating with the U.S. and GCC states to prevent a wider regional conflict, stepping up political pressure on Iran to prevent any weaponization of its nuclear program, and maintaining channels for de-escalation.22 They have offered assistance to the IAEA and emphasized the need for a revived diplomatic pathway, however challenging.22
Key Regional States:
The conflict's intensification directly impacts neighboring and influential states in the Middle East.
Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar: These Gulf Arab states have officially condemned the Israeli attacks on Iran and called for restraint and de-escalation.7 Their primary concerns are regional stability, the potential for Iranian retaliation that could affect their territories or economies, and the broader impact on global energy markets.7 Despite historical animosity towards Iran's regional policies, and some private expressions of satisfaction at pressure being applied to Tehran 35, their official posture prioritizes averting a wider war. Reports from earlier escalations in 2024 indicated that some Gulf states may have discreetly shared intelligence or participated in intercepting Iranian projectiles heading towards Israel, suggesting a nuanced, self-interested approach focused on mitigating direct threats to their own security.7
Turkey: Ankara condemned the Israeli attacks.24 Turkey maintains a complex and often strained relationship with Israel. While there was some past tacit coordination against mutual concerns in Syria (like the Assad regime and Iranian influence there), a growing rivalry and ideological differences, particularly over the Palestinian issue and Israel's actions in Gaza, have come to the fore.36 Turkey has also been suggested as a potential mediator in regional disputes.23
Jordan: Jordan closed its airspace during the June 2025 attacks and reiterated that it would not allow its territory to become a battleground.24 While publicly maintaining neutrality, Jordan's air force reportedly participated in downing Iranian drones during the April 2024 exchange.7
Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon: These nations have also expressed condemnation of the escalation and voiced serious concerns about regional stability.7 Lebanon, home to Iran's powerful proxy Hezbollah, is particularly vulnerable. Hezbollah condemned the Israeli strikes on Iran but did not immediately threaten to join in retaliation, likely reflecting its own strategic calculations following its recent devastating war with Israel.15
The varied reactions underscore the complex web of interests at play. While there is broad concern about a full-blown war, the strategic objectives of the primary belligerents and the competing interests of global and regional powers create a volatile environment where de-escalation efforts face significant hurdles.

D. Competing Interpretations and Contested Facts

The Israel-Iran conflict is characterized not only by kinetic actions but also by a persistent information war, where narratives are fiercely contested and facts are often obscured or selectively presented. Several key areas are subject to competing interpretations:
Nature and Justification of Israeli Strikes:
Israel's Narrative: Israeli authorities consistently frame their military actions, including "Operation Rising Lion" in June 2025, as necessary and preemptive acts of self-defense.1 The primary justification offered is the imperative to halt Iran's advancing nuclear program, which is portrayed as an imminent existential threat to Israel. Further, strikes are aimed at degrading Iran's conventional military capabilities and disrupting its support for regional proxies.6
Iran's Narrative and Counter-Claims: Iran and its supporters portray Israeli strikes as unprovoked acts of aggression, blatant violations of Iranian sovereignty, and attempts to destabilize the regime.9 Tehran has highlighted the targeting of residential areas and the resulting civilian casualties, accusing Israel of war crimes.1 Some international legal scholars have also termed the Israeli offensive a "crime of aggression".25
Alternative Strategic Interpretations: Some analysts suggest that the timing and magnitude of Israeli operations, particularly in June 2025, may have been calculated to provoke a significant Iranian response.26 Such a response could, from this perspective, be intended by some Israeli strategists to derail ongoing or potential diplomatic efforts (like the U.S.-Iran nuclear talks) and potentially create conditions that might draw the United States more directly into a broader conflict with Tehran.26
Damage Assessments and Operational Outcomes:
Israeli Claims: Israel has asserted that its strikes have caused significant damage to Iranian nuclear facilities (notably Natanz), military sites, and missile production capabilities, and successfully eliminated key military and scientific personnel.1 The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released annotated satellite imagery purporting to show damage at Natanz.2
Iranian Claims: Iranian officials initially sought to downplay the extent of damage to critical nuclear infrastructure, emphasizing the continued operation of their nuclear program and the resilience of their facilities.25 However, they did acknowledge the deaths of nuclear scientists.4 Iran has consistently reported that Israeli strikes have hit residential areas, leading to civilian deaths and injuries, with some unofficial local media reports suggesting higher casualty figures than officially acknowledged.1
Independent Analysis: Third-party analysis, including satellite imagery assessments by organizations like the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS-Online) and media outlets like the BBC, has provided partial corroboration of damage. Imagery confirmed extensive destruction to the above-ground electrical infrastructure and the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant (PFEP) at the Natanz site following the June 2025 strikes.2 However, these analyses also indicated that the main underground enrichment facilities at Natanz appeared less affected in the initial attacks, and other major nuclear sites like Arak showed no immediately visible damage.2 This highlights the difficulty in obtaining a complete and unbiased picture of the full extent of the damage.
Iran's Nuclear Intentions and Progress:
Iran's Official Position: Tehran consistently maintains that its nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful energy generation and medical purposes and that it is not seeking to develop nuclear weapons.15
Israeli and U.S. Assessments: Israel, along with various U.S. administrations, has long asserted that Iran is actively pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities or is, at minimum, striving to reach a point where it could rapidly produce them (a "breakout" capability).3 The IDF cited intelligence in June 2025 suggesting Iran was "approaching the point of no return" and advancing a "secret plan" to fast-track its program.7
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Position: The IAEA has expressed serious concerns about Iran's cooperation and transparency regarding its nuclear activities. In June 2025, the IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution censuring Iran for its lack of cooperation with inspectors.14 IAEA reports have also warned that Iran has accumulated enough enriched uranium that, if further enriched, could be sufficient for several nuclear weapons.14
Contested Intelligence: There can be divergences even within allied intelligence communities. For instance, a U.S. Director of National Intelligence report in March 2025 reportedly stated that Iran "is not building a nuclear weapon" at that time 7, which appeared to contrast with more alarmist Israeli assessments. This ambiguity surrounding Iran's precise proximity to weaponization and its ultimate intentions creates a perpetual gray zone that complicates policy responses and can be used to legitimize preemptive actions.
Significant Uncertainties:
Beyond these contested narratives, several critical uncertainties persist:
The full and accurate extent of casualties and comprehensive damage to military, nuclear, and civilian infrastructure inside Iran resulting from the June 2025 strikes.
The precise operational details and effectiveness of covert actions undertaken by both sides.
The long-term efficacy of Israeli strikes in genuinely setting back Iran's nuclear and missile programs versus merely delaying them or driving them further underground.
The true level of willingness and capability of Iran's regional proxies to engage in a sustained, high-intensity conflict on Iran's behalf.
The internal decision-making dynamics and political calculations within the leadership circles in both Tehran and Tel Aviv, which will heavily influence future actions.
This environment of contested facts and significant uncertainties contributes to the volatility of the conflict, increasing the risk of miscalculation and making diplomatic resolutions exceptionally challenging. The information warfare component is critical, as both Israel and Iran strive to shape international and domestic perceptions to their advantage, often making it difficult to discern ground truth from strategic messaging.

IV. Predictive Scenarios for Future Conflict Trajectory

The trajectory of the Israel-Iran conflict is subject to numerous variables, making precise predictions challenging. However, based on current dynamics, strategic objectives, capabilities, and the roles of external actors, several broad scenarios can be identified. The following table provides a comparative analysis of these scenarios:
Feature
Scenario 1: Protracted Controlled Escalation
Scenario 2: Major Regional Conflagration
Scenario 3: De-escalation and Tenuous Stalemate
Description
Continued pattern of calculated, reciprocal attacks (military strikes, covert ops, cyberattacks, proxy actions). Both sides avoid all-out war but engage in significant hostilities. Nuclear diplomacy stalled or fitful. 23
Significant miscalculation or crossing of a critical red line triggers full-scale, sustained, multi-front war. Widespread strikes, full proxy activation, potential direct U.S. involvement. Major disruption to global oil/trade. 23
Intensive third-party diplomatic intervention and mutual realization of excessive risks lead to a temporary cessation of overt hostilities. Tacit agreements, return to covert competition, possible limited nuclear talks. Underlying tensions remain. 23
Assessed Likelihood
High Probability
Medium Probability
Low-Medium Probability
Key Drivers (Factors Increasing Probability)
Deep mutual distrust; ideological motivations; internal political pressures; Israel's anti-nuclear stance & "mowing the grass" strategy 6; Iran's need for retaliation & deterrence 21; continued U.S. support for Israel.7
Current escalatory trajectory increasing miscalculation risk; Iran rapidly moves to weaponize 14; hardliner influence; uncontrolled proxy actions; unexpectedly devastating attack by one side.
Severe economic fallout 23; extreme international pressure 22; leadership/strategic changes in Tehran/Tel Aviv; mutually hurting stalemate; successful third-party mediation.23
Key Restraints (Factors Decreasing Probability)
Fear of uncontrollable escalation; significant international de-escalation pressure 22; economic costs 23; potential U.S. restraint 7; Iran's regime survival imperative.10
Prospect of mutual devastation; overwhelming U.S. military superiority if fully engaged; strong international consensus against such a war; Iran's conventional military inferiority.16
Deeply entrenched animosity & conflicting core objectives; verification difficulties; hardliner opposition to compromise; Israel's intolerance of Iran's ongoing nuclear program.5
Potential Triggers/ Catalysts
Further Israeli strikes on high-value Iranian targets; Iranian retaliation against Israeli or allied interests; successful cyberattacks; proxy flare-ups.
Confirmed Iranian nuclear weaponization/test; mass casualty attack on a major city; assassination of a top leader leading to disproportionate response; accidental targeting of U.S. forces.
A major, mutually damaging incident that shocks both sides into reassessment; a significant breakthrough in back-channel diplomacy; a change in U.S. policy towards more forceful de-escalation.
Broad Implications
Persistent regional instability; continued economic strain (energy prices, insurance); gradual erosion of red lines; ongoing risk of accidental escalation to Scenario 2.
Catastrophic humanitarian crisis; global economic recession (oil shock 23); potential for WMD use (low but non-zero); redrawing of regional alliances; severe damage to international order.
Temporary regional calm; opportunity for limited diplomatic engagement (e.g., nuclear safety); underlying conflict drivers remain, leading to eventual re-escalation if core issues are unresolved. Longer-term rearmament by all sides.23

A. Scenario 1: Protracted Controlled Escalation (High Probability)
This scenario envisages the continuation of the current pattern where Israel and Iran engage in a series of calculated, reciprocal hostilities that fall short of all-out war.23 Actions would likely include further Israeli strikes—potentially covert, cyber, or limited overt military operations—targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, military assets, IRGC personnel, or proxy-related infrastructure in Iran, Syria, Lebanon, or Iraq. Iran, in turn, would likely respond through a combination of means: limited direct missile or drone attacks against Israeli targets, actions by its regional proxies against Israeli or allied interests (including maritime disruptions in vital waterways like the Strait of Hormuz), and intensified cyber warfare.23
Factors Increasing Likelihood: The deep-seated mutual distrust and ideological animosity between Israel and Iran are primary drivers. Internal political dynamics in both nations often incentivize leaders to project strength and resolve. Israel's unwavering commitment to preventing a nuclear Iran, potentially through a strategy of "mowing the grass" involving periodic degradation of Iranian capabilities 6, suggests a willingness to undertake further offensive actions. Conversely, Iran feels compelled to retaliate for significant attacks on its sovereignty, personnel, and strategic assets to maintain its deterrent posture and domestic credibility.21 Continued robust U.S. political and military support for Israel also emboldens Israeli actions.7 The very nature of a protracted conflict involving repeated strikes, as implied by Israeli statements about the June 2025 operation continuing "for as long as necessary" 6, points towards this scenario.
Factors Decreasing Likelihood (from escalating to all-out war): A crucial restraining factor is the shared fear of uncontrollable escalation leading to a devastating regional war with catastrophic consequences for both sides. Significant international pressure from the UN, EU, and concerned Arab states for de-escalation plays a role.22 The severe economic costs associated with sustained, high-intensity conflict also act as a deterrent.23 While the U.S. supports Israel, it may exert pressure to moderate actions if they are perceived as excessively provocative or counterproductive to broader U.S. interests, such as regional stability or preventing a direct U.S.-Iran clash.7 Ultimately, Iran's primary strategic objective of regime survival makes it averse to actions that could trigger an existential conflict.10
This scenario, while appearing "controlled," is inherently unstable. It involves a continuous probing of boundaries and a constant risk that a specific action could be miscalculated or have unintended consequences, potentially triggering a rapid escalation towards a major conflagration. The cumulative effect of repeated strikes and retaliations can also lead to an erosion of previously respected red lines.
B. Scenario 2: Major Regional Conflagration (Medium Probability)
This scenario outlines a descent into a full-scale, sustained military conflict between Israel and Iran, potentially drawing in regional and international powers. Such a war would likely be triggered by a significant miscalculation by one or both sides, an unexpectedly devastating attack that demands massive retaliation, or the crossing of a critical, previously declared "red line." Examples of such triggers could include confirmed Iranian steps towards nuclear weaponization (such as a nuclear test), a successful mass-casualty attack on a major Israeli or Iranian city, or the assassination of a paramount leader leading to a disproportionate response.
Nature of Conflict: A major conflagration would likely involve widespread and sustained Israeli air and missile campaigns targeting a comprehensive range of strategic assets across Iran, including nuclear sites, military bases, command and control centers, economic infrastructure, and potentially leadership targets. Iran would likely retaliate with large-scale missile and drone attacks against Israeli population centers and critical infrastructure. Iran's regional proxies, particularly Hezbollah, could be fully activated, opening up multiple fronts against Israel, including from Lebanon and potentially Syria.23 The conflict could rapidly extend to maritime warfare, with attempts to disrupt shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, severely impacting global oil supplies.23
Factors Increasing Likelihood: The current escalatory trajectory inherently carries the risk of miscalculation or unintended escalation. If either side comes to believe that the other is on the verge of achieving a decisive strategic advantage or is about to cross an intolerable threshold (e.g., Iran's imminent acquisition of a nuclear weapon 14), the incentive for preemptive, large-scale action could become overwhelming. The empowerment of hardline factions in either country, advocating for more aggressive military solutions, could also push the situation towards this scenario. Furthermore, an attack by a proxy group that escalates beyond Iran's or the proxy's own control could inadvertently trigger a wider state-to-state war.
Factors Decreasing Likelihood: The primary restraint is the strong deterrence born from the prospect of mutual devastation and the potentially catastrophic consequences for regional stability and the global economy. The United States, if it chose to fully intervene, possesses overwhelming military superiority, a factor that Iran must consider.16 There is also a strong international consensus against such a war, which would exert considerable diplomatic pressure. Iran, in particular, is aware of its conventional military limitations when compared to a technologically advanced Israel, especially if backed by the U.S..16
While not the most probable outcome due to these powerful restraints, the conditions for such a conflagration are being incrementally created by the ongoing cycle of escalation.
C. Scenario 3: De-escalation and Tenuous Stalemate (Low-Medium Probability)
This scenario involves a significant reduction in overt hostilities, leading to a period of relative calm, albeit a fragile and tense one. This de-escalation would likely result from a combination of factors: intensive diplomatic intervention by third-party mediators (such as the United States, European nations, or regional actors like Qatar and Oman 23), coupled with a growing realization in both Tel Aviv and Tehran that the risks and costs of continued escalation are becoming unacceptably high.
Nature of De-escalation: This would likely involve tacit or informal agreements on respecting certain red lines, a mutual pullback from direct military confrontations, and a return to more covert or deniable forms of competition. It might create a narrow window for a return to limited diplomatic engagement, perhaps focused initially on crisis management, nuclear safety protocols, or even a pathway back to discussions on Iran's nuclear program, albeit under vastly different and more constrained conditions than before. However, the underlying sources of conflict—deep mistrust, ideological opposition, and competing strategic ambitions—would remain unresolved, making any stalemate tenuous and prone to future breakdown.
Factors Increasing Likelihood: A severe economic crisis in either or both countries, exacerbated by the conflict and international sanctions, could increase domestic pressure for de-escalation.23 Overwhelming and unified international pressure, particularly from major powers, could compel both sides to reconsider their approach.22 A particularly damaging incident that results in a mutually hurting stalemate, where neither side sees a viable path to victory through further escalation, could also create an opening for diplomacy. A significant change in leadership or strategic thinking in either Tehran or Tel Aviv, though less predictable, could also shift the calculus. The success of concerted mediation efforts by influential third parties is critical.23
Factors Decreasing Likelihood: The deeply entrenched animosity and fundamentally conflicting core objectives make sustained de-escalation exceptionally difficult. Verifying compliance with any informal de-escalation agreements would be challenging, fostering continued suspicion. Hardline factions in both Israel and Iran, who benefit from or ideologically favor confrontation, would likely oppose and seek to undermine any moves towards compromise. Critically, Israel's core security concern regarding Iran's ongoing nuclear program remains a persistent driver of conflict; as long as Iran retains or advances its enrichment capabilities, Israel is unlikely to accept a long-term stalemate that it perceives as allowing Iran to inch closer to a nuclear weapon.5 The history of failed diplomatic initiatives to resolve the core issues also casts a shadow over the prospects for lasting de-escalation.
Any de-escalation achieved under current circumstances would likely be a temporary reprieve rather than a permanent resolution, with both sides probably using the period to rearm and prepare for future contingencies.23

V. Most Likely Outcome and Justification

Based on the comprehensive analysis of strategic motivations, military capabilities, historical precedents, internal dynamics, and the current international context, the most likely outcome for the Israel-Iran conflict in the foreseeable future is Scenario 1: Protracted Controlled Escalation.
This assessment is grounded in several key factors:
Historical Precedent and Conflict Nature: The Israel-Iran conflict, spanning several decades, has predominantly been characterized by periods of contained hostility, covert operations, proxy warfare, and targeted assassinations, rather than sustained, all-out conventional warfare between the two states.3 The recent escalations in 2024 and 2025, while representing a significant shift towards more direct and overt confrontations, can be viewed as an intensification of this existing pattern rather than a complete departure into unrestrained war. Both sides have demonstrated a capacity for calibrated responses, even amidst heightened tensions.
Military Capabilities and Deterrence Dynamics: While both Israel and Iran possess formidable military capabilities, a clear asymmetry exists, particularly in advanced conventional weaponry and air power, where Israel holds a significant advantage.16 This imbalance is further magnified by the potential for United States involvement on Israel's behalf. Iran is acutely aware that a full-scale conventional war against Israel, especially with U.S. support, would be devastating and could threaten the regime's survival.10 This reality creates a degree of mutual deterrence against escalating to an all-out conflict, as the costs would be catastrophically high for both, but particularly for Iran.
Strategic Cultures and Objectives:
Israel: Israeli strategic culture often embraces the concept of "mowing the grass" 18 – conducting periodic military operations to degrade emerging threats and re-establish deterrence without seeking outright conquest or prolonged occupation of adversary territory. The June 2025 "Operation Rising Lion," while extensive, appears consistent with this approach: aiming to significantly set back Iran's nuclear and military programs and disrupt its leadership, rather than initiating an immediate, full-scale invasion aimed at regime overthrow, even if destabilization is a desired secondary effect.1
Iran: Iran's strategic doctrine has historically emphasized "strategic patience," asymmetric warfare, and the use of proxies to project influence and counter adversaries.10 While direct attacks on its soil have compelled more direct retaliation to maintain credibility, its overarching goal of regime preservation 10 inclines its leadership towards avoiding existential conflicts. Iran's response to the June 2025 Israeli strikes (e.g., the launch of approximately 100 drones 9) was significant but also appeared somewhat calibrated given the scale of the Israeli offensive, suggesting an attempt to respond without triggering an uncontrollable spiral.
International Pressure and the Role of the United States: There is substantial international pressure from the United Nations, the European Union, and key Arab states for de-escalation and the avoidance of a wider regional war.11 The United States, while a staunch ally of Israel and supportive of its right to self-defense 7, also has a strong interest in preventing a major conflagration in the Middle East that could endanger U.S. forces, destabilize global energy markets, and draw Washington into a costly and protracted conflict.7 This external pressure, particularly from the U.S., can act as a moderating influence, helping to cap escalations before they reach the point of no return.
Internal Dynamics and Constraints: Leaders in both Israel and Iran, despite the presence of hardline elements, are likely cognizant of the severe domestic consequences of an unrestrained war. These include the potential for massive casualties, widespread societal disruption, and economic collapse.7 Such considerations can temper decisions regarding the scale and scope of military actions.
While the "Protracted Controlled Escalation" scenario is deemed most likely, it is crucial to recognize that this is not a stable or benign state of affairs. It implies a persistent state of high tension, characterized by periodic military strikes, covert operations, cyber warfare, and proxy engagements. This dynamic equilibrium is inherently dangerous and carries a constant risk of miscalculation or unintended escalation that could inadvertently tip the conflict into a major regional conflagration (Scenario 2). The "control" in this scenario is relative and subject to constant recalibration by both sides, making the situation volatile and unpredictable. Each escalatory cycle within this scenario will further test red lines and potentially erode existing restraints, making the long-term maintenance of this "controlled" state increasingly challenging.

VI. Concluding Remarks and Strategic Implications

The Israel-Iran conflict has unequivocally transitioned into a more direct, overt, and perilous phase. The series of escalations throughout 2024, culminating in the extensive Israeli military operations against Iran in June 2025, marks a watershed moment. This shift from a predominantly shadow war to direct state-on-state military actions has profound strategic implications for regional security, global energy markets, nuclear proliferation, and international relations.
State of the Conflict: The conflict is now characterized by a willingness from both sides to engage in significant military actions directly against each other's territories and strategic assets. While a degree of calibration may still exist to avoid an all-out, existential war, the threshold for direct confrontation has been significantly lowered. This new normal is one of heightened alert, increased military deployments, and a persistent risk of rapid escalation.
Impact on Regional Security: The intensified conflict dramatically increases instability across the Middle East. Neighboring states, including Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and the Gulf Arab nations, face heightened risks of spillover, becoming inadvertent battlegrounds or targets. Existing proxy conflicts could intensify, or dormant ones could reignite, as both Israel and Iran seek to leverage their regional allies and assets. The stability of fragile states in the region is further threatened.
Global Energy Markets: Sustained conflict, particularly any actions that threaten the security of maritime transit through the Strait of Hormuz—a critical chokepoint for global oil supplies—will exert continued upward pressure on oil prices and induce significant volatility in global energy markets.23 This has broad implications for global economic stability and inflation.
Nuclear Proliferation Concerns: One of the most critical strategic implications revolves around nuclear proliferation. While Israel's actions are ostensibly aimed at preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons 5, the repeated and damaging strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and personnel may have the paradoxical effect of strengthening the arguments within Tehran for accelerating a clandestine nuclear weapons program as the ultimate deterrent.14 If Iran perceives its conventional deterrents and regime security to be failing in the face of Israeli military superiority, the allure of a nuclear arsenal could become irresistible. Such a development would not only fundamentally alter the strategic balance in the Middle East but could also trigger a dangerous cascade of nuclear proliferation among other regional powers.
International Relations and Geopolitics: The conflict strains existing alliances and partnerships, particularly for the United States, which must balance its support for Israel with its broader regional stability and non-proliferation goals.7 It also creates opportunities for other global powers, notably Russia and China, to expand their influence in the region by offering diplomatic, economic, or military support to Iran or positioning themselves as alternative mediators.19 The authority and efficacy of international institutions like the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency are also challenged as they struggle to manage the escalating crisis and enforce international norms.
Future of Diplomacy: In the short to medium term, the prospects for a comprehensive diplomatic resolution, such as a revived and expanded nuclear deal, appear exceptionally bleak.7 The heightened animosity, direct military exchanges, and deep-seated mistrust have severely damaged any remaining political space for such negotiations. Diplomatic efforts are more likely to be focused on crisis management, de-escalation mechanisms, establishing emergency communication channels, and preventing accidental war, rather than achieving grand bargains that address the root causes of the conflict.
The current trajectory suggests a protracted period of instability. The willingness of these significant regional powers to engage in direct, high-stakes military confrontations, at times seemingly constraining the ability of great powers like the United States to fully control regional dynamics, points to an increasing geopolitical volatility. Managing this new phase of the Israel-Iran conflict will require sophisticated statecraft, robust de-confliction mechanisms, and a concerted international effort to prevent the current controlled escalation from spiraling into a catastrophic regional war. The long-term consequences of failing to do so could reshape the strategic landscape of the Middle East and beyond for decades to come.
