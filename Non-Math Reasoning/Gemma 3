Okay, this is a complex mystery! Let's break down the clues and deduce the stalker's identity and Damon's reasoning.

The Stalker's Identity: Aaron

Here's the reasoning, piecing together the evidence:

The Wet/Dry Jacket: Leo was found with a jacket that was wet in some spots and dry in others. This is crucial. It suggests he was dragged across the ground, not simply falling. The wet spots would be from contact with snow/ice while being dragged, and the dry spots from being lifted.

The Pattern of Attacks: All the victims were alone and vulnerable while urinating. This suggests someone was specifically targeting them during a private moment.

Aaron's Behavior: Aaron was actively teasing Kristin about her period, creating a stressful and humiliating situation. This demonstrates a willingness to cause distress and exploit vulnerability.

Anna's Relief: Anna relieved herself close to the cabin because she was afraid to leave. This suggests a feeling of unease and potential threat.

Damon's Claim of Innocence: Damon immediately states the stalker is innocent, which is a red herring.

The Cave: All the victims were found in a cave, suggesting a single perpetrator moved them all there.

The Lone Stalker Description: All the girls described a lone stalker.

How Damon Knew (and Why He Initially Misdirected):

Damon likely realized Aaron was the stalker because of the following:

Aaron's Proximity: Aaron was present in the juniors' cabin throughout the night, giving him opportunities to slip away unnoticed.

Aaron's Cruelty: His behavior towards Kristin demonstrates a disturbing personality trait.

Aaron's Opportunity: Aaron could have easily followed Kristin when she ran off crying, and then targeted the others.

Damon's Initial Claim: Damon initially claimed the stalker was innocent to throw off suspicion and buy himself time to gather more evidence or formulate a plan. He likely wanted to be certain before making an accusation.

Why Aaron Would Do It:

The story doesn't explicitly state a motive, but we can infer:

Sadism/Control: Aaron seems to derive pleasure from causing distress to others. The attacks were about power and control, not sexual assault (given the descriptions).

Possible Underlying Issues: His behavior suggests potential psychological problems.

In conclusion, Aaron is the stalker. Damon likely deduced this through observing Aaron's behavior, considering the circumstances of the attacks, and recognizing the pattern of vulnerability exploitation.
