I see that you've shared a mystery story with me. Let me read it carefully and help you solve the mystery of who the stalker is and how Damon knew.
Based on the information provided in the story, here's my analysis:
The key clue is that Leo is the stalker. Damon figured this out through several suspicious circumstances surrounding Leo:

Leo claimed he left to take a shower at the dining hall (which was a half-hour walk away), but didn't remember actually taking a shower when he came to.
Leo returned after a short time, acting strangely, despite the dining hall being a significant distance away.
When they found Leo unconscious, his jacket was "dry in some spots, and wet in others," which is suspicious considering he was supposedly lying on his back in the snow.
Leo conveniently "ran after" Kristin when she fled the cabin upset, and she was the next person to disappear.
Leo's memory loss seems suspicious - he couldn't remember anything except leaving for a shower (but not actually taking one).

Damon likely realized that Leo's timeline, behavior, and the condition of his clothing didn't make sense unless he was the one attacking the others. The "memory loss" was likely a fabrication to cover his actions. The wet/dry spots on Leo's jacket despite lying on his back suggests he was active during the time he claimed to be unconscious.
Does this analysis align with what you were looking for in the mystery?
