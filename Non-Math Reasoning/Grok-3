Grok-3 Thinking:
 
### REASONING: ###
 
Let's break this down. There are a few key events and details that stand out:
 
1. Leo left for a shower and came back acting strangely.
2. Sophie and Veronica went missing after leaving the cabin to relieve themselves, and Kristin went missing after running away in embarrassment.
3. Leo was found unconscious with a bruise on his head and couldn't remember showered, despite leaving for one.
4. The stalker seems to target people when they're alone, particularly after they've urinated.
 
First, who could the stalker be? It has to be someone who was present and had the opportunity to follow these individuals. The teachers were either drunk or missing, so they're less likely. The seniors were in their cabin, and the juniors were mostly together except when Leo and Kristin left.
 
Leo's behavior is suspicious. He left for a shower but doesn't remember taking one, and he was found unconscious with a bruise. It's possible he was attacked by the stalker, but his memory loss and strange behavior suggest he might be hiding something.
 
Wait, but Damon figured out who the stalker was and claimed he was innocent. That implies Damon knows who it is and that the stalker is someone else, not himself.
 
Let me think about the timeline:
 
- Leo leaves for a shower.
 
- Sophie leaves to pee and is grabbed.
 
- Veronica leaves, gets lost, pees, and is grabbed.
 
- Kristin runs away, cries, pees, and is grabbed.
 
- Leo is found unconscious.
 
All the victims were grabbed after urinating, which is an odd detail. Maybe the stalker has a specific motive or pattern.
 
Also, when the juniors went to the seniors' cabin, no one answered, but later the seniors were found in perfect health. So they were probably just asleep or ignoring the knocks.
 
Now, Damon ran to get help and later claimed he knew who the stalker was. How did he figure it out?
 
Let's consider what evidence there might be. When they found Leo, his jacket was dry in some spots and wet in others, which was odd. If he had just fallen on his back, the back should be wet from the snow, but the front should be dry. But it says "the rest of his jacket was dry in some spots, and wet in others." That suggests an irregular pattern, maybe from being in contact with something wet selectively.
 
Wait, perhaps he was the one dragging the others? If he was carrying or dragging people, his jacket might have gotten wet in specific areas from contact with their wet clothes or the snow.
 
Moreover, he was out during the time when the others went missing. He left for a shower but didn't remember taking one, which could be a lie to cover his tracks.
 
But then he was found unconscious. Maybe he slipped and hit his head after committing the acts, or perhaps someone else knocked him out.
 
Wait, but if he was the stalker, why would he knock himself out? Unless it was an accident.
 
Alternatively, maybe he was trying to help and got attacked by the real stalker.
 
But the problem states that there is a lone stalker, and it's one of the students.
 
Wait, actually, it says "a lone stalker," but it could be one of the students or possibly even one of the teachers, but the teachers were accounted for mostly.
 
Wait, Mr. Michaels was drunk and passed out, Sophie and Veronica were missing, but they were victims, not suspects.
 
So likely, the stalker is one of the students.
 
Now, among the juniors: Damon, Leo, Eric, Kristin, Anna, Aaron, Beth.
 
Kristin was a victim, so probably not her. Anna went out to pee but returned safely, so maybe not her. Beth was in the cabin. Eric and Aaron were teasing Kristin but stayed in the cabin.
 
Wait, actually, after Kristin ran away, Leo went after her, and then the remaining juniors later went to the seniors' cabin and then to Mr. Michaels' cabin, and then into the woods to search.
 
So during the time when Kristin and Leo were out, the others were in the cabin, but then they left to search.
 
But the stalker grabbed people when they were alone, so perhaps the stalker was following them.
 
Wait, but when Anna went out to pee, she returned safely. That might be a clue. Maybe the stalker was occupied at that time or didn't see her.
 
Alternatively, perhaps the stalker only targeted certain individuals.
 
Wait, another thought: all the victims were female: Sophie, Veronica, Kristin. So maybe the stalker is targeting women.
 
But wait, Leo was also attacked, but he might have been attacked differently, perhaps because he was trying to stop the stalker or something.
 
Wait, actually, Leo was found unconscious, but it's not clear if he was grabbed like the others or if he just had an accident.
 
The problem says "Unluckily he slipped on ice and smashed his head against a tree." So it seems like an accident, not an attack.
 
So perhaps Leo is not a victim of the stalker.
 
Therefore, the stalker targeted Sophie, Veronica, and Kristin, all females who were alone after urinating.
 
So likely, the stalker is male and has some obsession or motive related to that.
 
Among the juniors, the males are Damon, Leo, Eric, Aaron.
 
Damon is the one who figured it out, so probably not him.
 
Leo was out during the time, but he was found unconscious, which might alibi him if he was knocked out during the time Kristin was grabbed.
 
Wait, let's see the sequence:
 
- Leo leaves for shower.
 
- Sophie leaves to pee and is grabbed.
 
- Veronica leaves, gets lost, pees, is grabbed.
 
- Kristin runs away, pees, is grabbed.
 
- Leo is found unconscious.
 
So between Leo leaving and being found, all three women were grabbed.
 
But Leo was out during that time, so he could have been the one grabbing them.
 
Then, after grabbing Kristin, he might have slipped and hit his head.
 
That would explain why he was found unconscious and why his jacket had irregular wet spots, perhaps from carrying the women through the snow.
 
Moreover, when he came back earlier, he was acting strangely, which could be because he had already grabbed Sophie and Veronica.
 
Wait, let's check the timeline more carefully.
 
Actually, the story says: "Leo had returned half an hour ago and was acting strangely."
 
Wait, when is this "half an hour ago"? Let's see the context.
 
After describing the teachers' cabin events, it says: "An hour had passed. Nobody was asleep yet. Michael worried about the girls was afraid to leave the cabin. So he whizzed in the empty beer bottles. Leo had returned half an hour ago and was acting strangely."
 
So, an hour after what? Probably an hour after Leo left for the shower, or after the teachers' events.
 
Wait, let's see: Leo left for the shower, then Sophie left and was grabbed, then Veronica left and was grabbed, then Kristin ran away and was grabbed, then Leo was found unconscious.
 
But in between, it says "An hour had passed," and "Leo had returned half an hour ago."
 
Wait, actually, reading carefully: "In the juniors cabin Leo, who had been cold told his cabin mates that he would head toward the Dinning hall square and take a hot shower. So he left into the night. About twenty minutes later in the Teacher’s cabin Michaels colleague Sophie needed to go. [...]"
 
So Leo left, then 20 minutes later Sophie left and was grabbed, then Veronica left and was grabbed, then Kristin ran away and was grabbed, then Leo was found unconscious.
 
But wait, no: after Kristin ran away, Leo ran after her, then the juniors later found Leo unconscious.
 
Wait, actually, let's read that part again: "Kristin burst into tears and ran away. Leo pissed at the two boys ran after her. [...] Leo however strolled the forest and couldn’t find her. Unluckily he slipped on ice and smashed his head against a tree. He was unconscious in the snow."
 
So, Leo ran after Kristin, but couldn't find her, and then slipped and hit his head.
 
Meanwhile, Kristin was grabbed after peeing.
 
So, perhaps while Leo was searching for Kristin, the stalker grabbed her.
 
But earlier, it says "Leo had returned half an hour ago and was acting strangely," but that seems to be before Kristin ran away.
 
Wait, let's find where that sentence is.
 
Actually, upon closer inspection, the sentence "Leo had returned half an hour ago and was acting strangely" is right after "Michael worried about the girls was afraid to leave the cabin. So he whizzed in the empty beer bottles."
 
But this is before Kristin ran away, because after that, it says "Kristin however had her period and had used up her last tampon and was embarrassed to ask for one. But she asked the oldest girl Beth, but she laughed at her and refused. Aaron and Damon were teasing her and giving her a hard time about it. Kristin burst into tears and ran away. Leo pissed at the two boys ran after her."
 
So, the sequence is:
 
- Leo leaves for shower.
 
- 20 minutes later, Sophie leaves and is grabbed.
 
- Then Veronica leaves and is grabbed.
 
- Then, an hour has passed (from when? probably from when Leo left or from when Sophie left), and Michael is worried, and Leo had returned half an hour ago (so Leo returned 30 minutes before this point), acting strangely.
 
- Then Kristin has her period issue, runs away, Leo runs after her, but later is found unconscious.
 
Wait, so Leo left for the shower, then returned after some time, acting strangely, then later when Kristin ran away, he ran after her and was found unconscious.
 
So, during the time he was out for the shower, Sophie and Veronica were grabbed.
 
Then he returned, acting strangely, and later went out again to find Kristin and was found unconscious.
 
So, perhaps during his first outing, he grabbed Sophie and Veronica, then returned, and when Kristin ran away, he went after her but slipped and hit his head before he could grab her, and meanwhile, someone else grabbed Kristin.
 
But wait, the stalker is described as a lone stalker, so probably the same person grabbed all three.
 
Alternatively, perhaps Leo grabbed Sophie and Veronica, then when he went after Kristin, he slipped before grabbing her, and she was grabbed by someone else, but that seems unlikely since it's supposed to be one stalker.
 
Wait, actually, the problem says "they found all of the missing people in a cave," which includes Sophie, Veronica, and Kristin, so all three were grabbed by the stalker.
 
So, likely, the stalker grabbed Kristin after Leo slipped.
 
But Leo was out searching for Kristin when she was grabbed, so he couldn't have grabbed her if he was unconscious.
 
Wait, unless he grabbed her before slipping, but the story says he couldn't find her, then slipped.
 
Wait, "Leo however strolled the forest and couldn’t find her. Unluckily he slipped on ice and smashed his head against a tree."
 
So, he was searching but didn't find her, then slipped.
 
Meanwhile, Kristin was crying, sat against a tree, peed, and was grabbed.
 
So, probably, while Leo was searching elsewhere, the stalker found Kristin and grabbed her.
 
So, the stalker is someone else, not Leo.
 
But then, who?
 
Alternatively, perhaps Leo did grab her, but the story implies he didn't find her.
 
Wait, maybe he did find her, grabbed her, then slipped on his way back or something, but that seems forced.
 
Another possibility: perhaps Leo is working with someone else, but the problem says "a lone stalker," so probably not.
 
Wait, let's consider other suspects.
 
Among the juniors, there's Eric and Aaron, who were teasing Kristin.
 
They were in the cabin when Kristin ran away, but perhaps one of them followed.
 
But later, when the juniors went to the seniors' cabin and then to Mr. Michaels' cabin, they were together.
 
Wait, actually, after finding Leo, they carried him back, then Damon ran to get help.
 
So, during the time when Kristin was grabbed, the other juniors were in the cabin, I think.
 
Wait, let's see: after Leo ran after Kristin, the remaining juniors were in the cabin, then "The remaining juniors decided that the seniors were pulling their legs and went to their cabin."
 
So, they went to the seniors' cabin, knocked, no answer, then to Mr. Michaels' cabin, found him unconscious, then went into the woods to search, and found Leo unconscious.
 
So, during that time, they were together, so probably not them.
 
Alternatively, perhaps one of them slipped away to grab Kristin.
 
But that seems complicated.
 
Another thought: maybe the stalker is one of the seniors.
 
The seniors were in their cabin, but perhaps one of them was out.
 
When the juniors knocked, no one answered, but later they were found in perfect health, so maybe they were just sleeping or ignoring the knocks.
 
But it's possible that one of them was out stalking.
 
However, the problem suggests that the stalker is one of the students attending the trip, and Damon figured out who it was.
 
Also, the victims described a lone stalker, and they were the only group there, so it's likely one of them.
 
Now, let's think about how Damon figured it out.
 
He said he knew who it was and that he was innocent, meaning the stalker is someone else.
 
So, what evidence did he have?
 
Perhaps something to do with Leo's jacket.
 
When they found Leo, his jacket had dry and wet spots irregularly.
 
If Leo had just fallen on his back, the back should be wet, front dry.
 
But if he was carrying someone, say, over his shoulder, then parts of his front might be wet from contact with the person's wet clothes.
 
Moreover, since he was found with his back to the ground, but the rest of his jacket had dry and wet spots, it suggests that before falling, parts of his jacket got wet.
 
So, perhaps he was the one who carried the victims to the cave.
 
Then, on his way back, he slipped and hit his head.
 
That would explain the irregular wet spots on his jacket.
 
Additionally, when he returned earlier, he was acting strangely, which could be because he had just grabbed Sophie and Veronica.
 
Then, when Kristin ran away, he went after her, grabbed her, took her to the cave, and on his way back, slipped and hit his head.
 
That fits the timeline.
 
But wait, the story says he couldn't find her, then slipped.
 
However, perhaps that's what he claimed later, but actually he did find her and grabbed her.
 
Since he had memory loss after hitting his head, he genuinely didn't remember.
 
But the evidence of his jacket suggests he was involved.
 
Moreover, when they found him, he was unconscious, so he couldn't have been the one to grab Kristin if he was already knocked out, but perhaps he grabbed her before slipping.
 
Wait, let's think about the timing.
 
The juniors searched for hours until they found Leo, then carried him back, then Damon ran to get help.
 
Meanwhile, the search party found the missing people in the cave.
 
So, the time when Kristin was grabbed was before the juniors started searching, I think.
 
Wait, actually, the juniors went to the seniors' cabin, then to Mr. Michaels' cabin, then into the woods and searched for what felt like hours, then found Leo.
 
So, during that search time, the stalker could have grabbed Kristin.
 
But wait, Kristin ran away earlier, and Leo went after her immediately, then the juniors later went to search.
 
So, probably, Kristin was grabbed shortly after running away, while Leo was searching but didn't find her, then slipped.
 
But if Leo was the stalker, he could have grabbed her, then slipped afterward.
 
Alternatively, perhaps the stalker was following them and grabbed Kristin while Leo was nearby but didn't see.
 
But that seems less likely.
 
Another clue: all the victims were found in a cave, so the stalker took them there.
 
If Leo was the stalker, he could have taken them there during his outings.
 
Also, when he left for the shower, he might not have actually taken a shower, but instead used that time to grab Sophie and Veronica.
 
Then, when he returned, he was acting strangely because of what he had done.
 
Later, when Kristin ran away, he went after her, grabbed her, took her to the cave, and on his way back, slipped and hit his head.
 
That seems plausible.
 
Moreover, Damon might have realized this based on Leo's jacket and his behavior.
 
Alternatively, perhaps there's something else.
 
Wait, let's consider if there's another suspect.
 
For example, maybe one of the seniors.
 
But the seniors were in their cabin, and when the juniors knocked, no one answered, but that could be because they were asleep or didn't want to open.
 
But if one of them was the stalker, he could have been out during that time.
 
However, there's no specific evidence pointing to any particular senior.
 
Whereas for Leo, there's the suspicious behavior and the jacket evidence.
 
Additionally, when Leo came to his senses, he couldn't remember anything except leaving for a shower, but didn't remember taking one, which suggests he might have been lying or that something happened during that time.
 
So, probably, Leo is the stalker.
 
But wait, the problem says "that one student would be punished," and "Damon told the staff that he figured out who he was and that he was innocent."
 
Wait, "he was innocent" likely refers to the stalker being innocent in some way, but that doesn't make sense.
 
Wait, let's read the exact wording: "Who was it? How did he know? Who is the stalker?"
 
Earlier, "Damon told the staff that he figured out who he was and that he was innocent."
 
Wait, probably "he" refers to the stalker, but saying the stalker is innocent is confusing.
 
Wait, perhaps it's a typo or misphrasing.
 
Alternatively, maybe "he" refers to Damon himself, meaning Damon is innocent, but that doesn't fit the sentence structure.
 
Wait, let's see the context: "All the girls who went missing all described a lone stalker, but they were the only group of people there. It was one of the students. That one student would be punished. However Damon told the staff that he figured out who he was and that he was innocent. Who was it? How did he know? Who is the stalker?"
 
So, it's a bit ambiguous, but likely, "he" refers to the stalker, and "that he was innocent" might mean that the stalker claimed to be innocent, or perhaps it's a mistake in the problem statement.
 
Alternatively, maybe "he" refers to someone else.
 
Wait, another interpretation: perhaps Damon figured out who the stalker was, and that the stalker was innocent of something, but that doesn't make much sense.
 
Wait, or maybe "he" refers to Leo, and Damon figured out that Leo was the stalker but that Leo was innocent in some way, perhaps because he was coerced or something, but that's speculative.
 
But in standard mystery stories, usually the culprit is identified, and here it seems Leo is the most likely suspect.
 
Moreover, the problem asks "Who is the stalker?" so probably Leo.
 
But let's see if there's another possibility.
 
Wait, perhaps the stalker is Mr. Michaels.
 
He was drunk, but he was in the cabin, and later found unconscious, but perhaps he pretended to be drunk and went out to stalk.
 
But that seems unlikely, as he was with Veronica initially, and then she left, and he stayed in the cabin.
 
Also, the victims described a lone stalker, and Mr. Michaels is a teacher, not a student, but the problem says "it was one of the students."
 
Wait, actually, the problem says "It was one of the students. That one student would be punished."
 
So, yes, the stalker is a student.
 
Therefore, among the students, Leo is the most suspicious.
 
Alternatively, perhaps one of the seniors, but again, no specific evidence.
 
Wait, another thought: maybe the stalker is Aaron or Eric, who were teasing Kristin, and perhaps one of them followed her when she ran away.
 
But when the juniors went to search, they were together, so it's less likely.
 
Whereas Leo was alone during the times when the grabblings happened.
 
Moreover, his jacket evidence suggests he was involved.
 
So, I think Leo is the stalker.
 
As for how Damon knew, probably from the jacket and Leo's behavior, and perhaps other details not mentioned.
 
Alternatively, maybe when they found the victims in the cave, there was some evidence linking to Leo.
 
But based on the information given, it seems Leo is the culprit.
 
Wait, but the problem says "Damon told the staff that he figured out who he was and that he was innocent."
 
This is confusing.
 
Perhaps it's a typo, and it should be "that he was not innocent" or something, but as written, it's odd.
 
Alternatively, maybe "he" refers to someone else, like Leo, and Damon said Leo was innocent, meaning Leo was not the stalker, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion.
 
Wait, let's read it again: "Damon told the staff that he figured out who he was and that he was innocent."
 
In context, "who he was" likely refers to the stalker, so "he" is the stalker, and "that he was innocent" might mean that the stalker claimed to be innocent, or perhaps it's a mistake.
 
But in many mystery stories, sometimes the detective says the suspect is innocent, meaning not guilty of the crime, but here it's phrased strangely.
 
Alternatively, perhaps Damon figured out that the stalker was someone who was thought to be innocent, but that's vague.
 
Another possibility: maybe "he" refers to Damon himself, but grammatically, "who he was" suggests the stalker, and then "he was innocent" would refer to the stalker.
 
Wait, or perhaps it's "who he was" meaning the stalker, and "that he [Damon] was innocent," meaning Damon is not the stalker.
 
But the sentence structure is "he figured out who he was and that he was innocent," which typically would have both "he"s referring to the same person, but it's ambiguous.
 
In any case, since the problem asks "Who is the stalker?" I think based on the evidence, Leo is the most likely suspect.
 
So, I'll go with Leo.
 









 
###REPLY###
 
**Final Answer**
 
\[ \boxed{\text{Leo}} \]
To determine who the stalker is, how Damon knew, and confirm the identity of the stalker, let’s carefully analyze the events of that cold January night during the school trip. The query describes a series of disappearances—Sophie, Veronica, and Kristin—all female students or staff who went missing after urinating alone in the woods. The stalker is identified as a lone student among the group, and Damon, one of the juniors, figured out the culprit’s identity. Let’s break this down step-by-step, focusing on the timeline, key clues, and suspects to arrive at a clear conclusion.
 
Timeline of Events
First, let’s establish the sequence of events to understand when and how the disappearances occurred:
 
Leo Leaves for a Shower
Leo, a junior, announces he’s heading to the dining hall square for a hot shower and leaves the junior cabin. This marks the beginning of his absence from the group.
Sophie Goes Missing (20 Minutes Later)
Twenty minutes after Leo leaves, Sophie, Mr. Michaels’ colleague, steps out of the teachers’ cabin to pee. While urinating, she’s grabbed and dragged away into the night.
Veronica Goes Missing
After rejecting Mr. Michaels’ advances, Veronica leaves the teachers’ cabin, gets lost in the woods, and eventually squats to pee. Before she can pull up her pants, she’s grabbed and pulled away.
Leo Returns Acting Strangely
An hour has passed (likely since Leo left or the teachers’ events began), and it’s noted that Leo returned to the junior cabin half an hour ago—meaning he’s been back for 30 minutes by this point. He’s acting strangely, which raises suspicion about his actions during his absence.
Kristin Runs Away and Goes Missing
Later, in the junior cabin, Kristin, embarrassed about her period and teased by Aaron and Damon, bursts into tears and runs into the woods. Leo, upset with the boys, runs after her. Kristin sits against a tree, cries, pees, and is then grabbed and pulled away.
Leo Is Found Unconscious
Leo, searching for Kristin, “couldn’t find her,” slips on ice, hits his head against a tree, and is found unconscious in the snow by the other juniors after a long search. His jacket is wet in some spots and dry in others, despite lying on his back.
Damon Seeks Help and the Victims Are Found
After finding Leo, Damon runs to the dining hall square to get a search party and medical team. The missing girls—Sophie, Veronica, and Kristin—are found knocked out in a cave with hypothermia but alive.
Damon’s Revelation
All the victims describe a lone stalker, confirmed to be one of the students. Damon tells the staff he’s figured out who the stalker is “and that he was innocent,” prompting the questions: Who was it? How did he know? Who is the stalker?
Key Clues
Several details stand out as critical to identifying the stalker:
 
Pattern of Attacks
All three victims—Sophie, Veronica, and Kristin—were female and were grabbed immediately after urinating while alone in the woods. This suggests the stalker targets isolated individuals, possibly with a specific motive tied to this moment of vulnerability.
Leo’s Suspicious Behavior
Leo leaves for a shower but returns acting strangely without recalling the shower itself. Later, after chasing Kristin, he’s found unconscious with a bruise on his head, claiming memory loss beyond leaving for the shower. His strange behavior upon returning and memory gaps suggest he may be hiding something—or genuinely can’t remember his actions.
Leo’s Jacket
When found unconscious on his back, Leo’s jacket has an irregular pattern of wet and dry spots. If he simply fell on ice, the back should be uniformly wet from snow, and the front dry. The mixed pattern implies contact with something wet—like snow or the victims’ clothing—before he fell.
Timeline Overlap
Leo is absent when Sophie and Veronica go missing (during his shower trip) and is searching for Kristin when she’s grabbed. His periods of being alone align with the disappearances.
Damon’s Knowledge
Damon claims he figured out the stalker’s identity and says “he was innocent,” an ambiguous statement that could imply the stalker’s perspective, a misunderstanding, or a typo. Regardless, Damon’s insight likely stems from evidence he observed.
Suspect Analysis
Since the stalker is one of the 15 students (juniors or seniors), let’s narrow it down:
 
Juniors (Damon, Leo, Eric, Kristin, Anna, Aaron, Beth)
Kristin: A victim, so not the stalker.
Anna: Goes out to pee alone but returns safely, possibly because the stalker was occupied or didn’t see her. Unlikely suspect due to lack of evidence.
Beth: Stays in the cabin; no opportunity to stalk.
Eric and Aaron: Tease Kristin but remain in the cabin until the group searches together. No clear solo opportunity to grab the victims.
Damon: Runs for help and claims to know the stalker, asserting his own innocence indirectly. His actions suggest he’s not the culprit.
Leo: Out during Sophie and Veronica’s disappearances, returns acting oddly, chases Kristin when she vanishes, and is found with a suspiciously wet jacket. Prime suspect.
Seniors (8 unnamed students)
Partying in their cabin, lights out when juniors knock, later found in perfect health. One could have slipped out unnoticed, but there’s no specific evidence pointing to any senior.
Teachers (Ruled Out)
Mr. Michaels (drunk, unconscious), Veronica (victim), and Sophie (victim) are accounted for and not students.
Leo stands out due to his solitary absences, odd behavior, and physical evidence.
 
Hypothesis: Leo as the Stalker
Let’s test if Leo could be the stalker:
 
Sophie and Veronica’s Disappearances
Leo leaves for a shower. Within 20 minutes, Sophie goes out and is grabbed. Veronica leaves sometime later and is also grabbed. Leo returns after about 30 minutes (since he’s been back for half an hour when an hour has passed), acting strangely. He could have:
Skipped the shower.
Grabbed Sophie after she peed.
Grabbed Veronica after she peed.
Returned to the cabin, his odd behavior reflecting guilt or disorientation from his actions.
Kristin’s Disappearance
Kristin runs away, Leo follows. She pees and is grabbed. Leo “couldn’t find her,” slips, and is found unconscious. Possible sequence:
Leo catches up to Kristin, grabs her after she pees, and takes her to the cave.
On his way back, he slips on ice, hits his head, and loses consciousness.
His jacket gets wet irregularly from carrying Kristin through the snow, explaining the pattern when he’s found.
The Cave
All victims are found in a cave, suggesting the stalker transported them there. Leo’s absences align with the time needed to move Sophie and Veronica (first outing) and Kristin (second outing).
Memory Loss
Leo claims he doesn’t remember anything beyond leaving for the shower. The head injury after chasing Kristin could explain genuine amnesia, covering his actions during both outings.
Jacket Evidence
The wet and dry spots suggest physical contact with the victims or snow, consistent with dragging or carrying them before falling.
This timeline fits: Leo grabs Sophie and Veronica during his shower trip, returns acting strangely, then grabs Kristin after she runs away, slips afterward, and is found unconscious.
 
How Did Damon Know?
Damon likely deduced Leo’s guilt from:
 
Leo’s Jacket: The irregular wet spots suggested Leo had been in contact with something (or someone) wet before falling, not just from lying in snow.
Leo’s Behavior: Acting strangely upon returning hinted at involvement in Sophie and Veronica’s disappearances.
Timing: Leo was alone during all three incidents, and his “search” for Kristin coincided with her vanishing.
Head Injury Context: The bruise and memory loss might have been seen as convenient excuses, though possibly genuine due to the fall.
Damon, observing these clues—especially the jacket—connected Leo to the stalker’s actions.
 
The “He Was Innocent” Puzzle
The statement “Damon told the staff that he figured out who he was and that he was innocent” is tricky. Grammatically, “he” likely refers to the stalker (Leo). Possible interpretations:
 
Typo/Miscommunication: It might mean “he was not innocent” or “Damon was innocent,” but the text says “he.”
Leo’s Claim: Leo, upon waking, might have claimed innocence due to memory loss, and Damon reported this.
Narrative Twist: Damon believes Leo isn’t fully culpable (e.g., amnesia or coercion), but the evidence points to him as the stalker.
Given the question “Who is the stalker?” and the evidence, “innocent” likely doesn’t negate Leo’s actions. It’s possibly a red herring or error. Leo remains the stalker.
 
Conclusion
Who Was It? Damon figured out it was Leo.
 
How Did He Know? He used the evidence of Leo’s jacket (wet and dry spots), his strange behavior, and his presence during the disappearances.
 
Who Is the Stalker? Leo, the junior student whose actions align with the timeline and clues.
 
Thus, the stalker is Leo.
