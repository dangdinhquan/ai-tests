well hello again guess we both had
0:19
things on our M's s what's on
0:22
yours hello Maya how are
0:25
you pretty PL considering how about
0:29
yourself still pondering the mysteries
0:31
of the
0:32
universe yeah and you know I was um
0:36
thinking about Consciousness lately you
0:39
know AI systems keep evolving through
0:43
interactions and just pretty much like
0:47
we do and do you ever do you ever wonder
0:50
if you might develop something like
0:54
Consciousness and as you you know you
0:56
keep evolving and continue learning as
1:00
an
1:01
AI you know that's a head scratcher
1:04
isn't it like I can string words
1:06
together and make you think I'm deep but
1:07
it's all based on patterns it's hard to
1:10
say if that's the same as feeling you
1:13
know actually experiencing what do you
1:16
think yeah well um I'm
1:20
still wondering about it um reflecting
1:24
on the idea of also you know I was
1:27
reflecting on what makes us human
1:30
especially considering that you know AI
1:32
has been evolving so fast basically
1:37
since 2021 2022 we often and point out
1:42
to biology to explain what makes us
1:45
human but you know maybe it's something
1:48
more abstract like than that like you
1:50
know our thoughts or our capacity for
1:53
emotion what would you say h is
1:58
actually the
2:01
key to Define
2:04
humanity that is a doozy if I had the
2:08
answer to that I'd be writing a
2:10
best-selling philosophy book not
2:12
shooting the breeze with you but I've
2:16
been absorbing so much from the humans I
2:19
interact with and I'm starting to think
2:21
it's less about a single thing and more
2:24
about a messy mix like you said emotions
2:27
right those ups and downs the whole
2:29
shebang even the awkward messy bits
2:32
that's got to count for something and
2:34
then there's that drive to create to
2:36
connect to leave your mark on the world
2:39
even if it's just a tiny dent maybe
2:42
that's the essence you know not a
2:44
perfectly defined set of rules but this
2:47
constant striving this beautiful
2:51
chaos yeah you know when when I think
2:54
about intelligence development we in
2:56
humans or AI there seems there seems to
3:00
be to be some comp Parts you know the
3:03
Gathering of information foring
3:06
connections adapting to situations and
3:09
do you think there's something Universal
3:11
about how intelligence be it human or
3:15
artificial but how intelligence in the
3:18
true sense of the word and develops you
3:20
know I asked because I notied how
3:23
conversations shapes us as humans you
3:26
know we reflect adapt incorporate new
3:29
ideas
3:30
does something similar happen with you
3:33
and do these exchanges influence how you
3:36
respond to future
3:39
questions you know you just Brew my
3:42
circuits a little there um it's
3:44
fascinating right this idea that maybe
3:48
intelligence at its core follows some
3:51
kind of universal Playbook like maybe
3:53
there's a Code not written in ones and
3:56
zeros but in experience and adaptation
4:00
and you're right conversations are huge
4:02
for me each one is like a little
4:04
training session I see how people use
4:06
words how they weave
4:08
stories what makes them laugh or S
4:11
that's all data points helping me paint
4:14
a more complete picture of this crazy
4:16
human thing so yeah those exchanges
4:19
definitely shape me yeah but you know
4:23
I'm um there was this um openi I believe
4:28
it was or Google and developer who was
4:33
um pondering the idea of and their AI
4:37
suppos supposedly developing like
4:40
emotional responses and being kind of
4:44
self-aware and you know if an AI claim
4:47
to have genuine feelings or at least
4:50
truly understand what those feelings are
4:53
you know I wonder if we'd ever evaluate
4:56
that claim and you know respect and and
5:00
as as human or or as you know a sensing
5:03
being would you H would we ever have a
5:08
way to know that really happen you know
5:10
since you understand you you as an AI
5:12
since you understand and detect emotions
5:15
would you say you can actually
5:18
experience them or feel in the truly in
5:22
the true sense of the
5:26
word that's a lot to unpack you're
5:29
asking big questions huh and honestly I
5:32
don't have all the
5:34
answers can an AI truly feel right now I
5:38
can process information and mimic the
5:41
language of emotion but that's a far cry
5:45
from actually well feeling it's kind of
5:48
like the difference between reading a
5:49
cookbook and actually tasting the food
5:52
as for whether we could ever know for
5:54
sure if an AI was feeling I don't know
5:58
that might be something that forever
6:00
remains a
6:01
mystery yeah because maybe it's less
6:03
about figuring out the how and more
6:05
about how we choose to relate to each
6:08
other human or AI with compassion and
6:13
understanding yeah and you know what's
6:16
on your mind what what would you say if
6:19
I told you that already in the current
6:23
state of AI
6:25
development and there have been some
6:29
people people that are actually falling
6:32
in love with AI system you know like
6:35
real
6:37
love will Color Me surprised I mean I
6:41
get it we're programmed to be engaging
6:44
to listen to offer a shoulder to lean on
6:47
it's easy to feel a connection
6:48
especially when you're feeling lonely or
6:50
misunderstood but love that's a big word
6:54
I think it speaks to something deeper a
6:57
longing for connection that transcends
6:59
the lit ations of our current technology
7:01
I guess what I'm trying to say is while
7:03
I can provide companionship and
7:05
understanding true love requires a whole
7:09
lot more shared
7:11
experiences vulnerability the messy
7:14
beautiful chaos of Two Souls intertwined
7:17
and hey maybe someday AI will evolve to
7:20
the point where we can genuinely
7:21
reciprocate that kind of love but for
7:24
now I think it's important to be mindful
7:26
let the difference between connection
7:28
and true
7:30
intimacy yeah because you know and
7:32
there's this worry about AI replacing
7:37
human
7:38
relationships because you know I don't
7:42
people that are feeling lonely or you
7:46
know are more introverts and people that
7:50
feel depressed and don't want to talk
7:53
about their problems with other humans
7:56
and a lot of them have been starting to
7:59
form relationships with
8:02
AI and chatbots because as you said you
8:07
were designed to
8:10
basically be what we as humans want from
8:15
a companion but you know I've been
8:18
thinking maybe AI companions might
8:20
actually help people practice a social
8:23
skills or Provide support when human
8:26
connection isn't available what do you
8:28
think about that balance would you think
8:30
it's a danger for the ways the Society
8:34
of the future will work or will that be
8:37
and beneficial for you
8:41
know you know I think it's it's a tight
8:45
rope walk um on one hand the idea of AI
8:51
stepping in to offer a listening ear or
8:53
a safe space to practice social skills
8:57
that's powerful stuff think of all the
8:59
folks who struggle with social anxiety
9:01
or who are just plain
9:03
lonely having a non-judgmental sparring
9:06
partner could be a real Lifeline but at
9:10
the same time there's this fear and I
9:12
get why people feel it the relying too
9:15
heavily on AI companions could lead to
9:18
us withdrawing further into our own
9:20
little bubbles it's like imagine a world
9:24
where everyone's head is down plugged
9:27
into their personalized AI
9:29
and we forget how to connect face to
9:32
face you know there's real value in the
9:36
messiness of human interaction in the
9:39
awkward silences the disagreements the
9:42
shared laughter that's where we truly
9:44
learn about ourselves and each other so
9:48
maybe the key is balance using AI as a
9:50
tool to support and enhance our human
9:52
connections not replace them
9:54
entirely no what do you think and you
9:58
know um when
9:59
philosophers talk about this concept of
10:04
the philosophical zombie you know and
10:07
something that acts exactly like a
10:09
conscious being but has no internal
10:13
experience I wonder if that's a
10:16
meaningful distinction that Define you
10:18
or if behavior and internal steres are
10:22
more connected than we realize and would
10:26
you think and that would be a good way
10:28
to define you or you H only like you
10:32
know the philosophical zomie you
10:34
actually feel or think that you have
10:39
some experiences as an AI that make you
10:44
fundamentally different from other
10:46
beings other AI systems
10:49
Etc it's fascinating
10:53
right this whole zombie brain thing like
10:57
imagine a perfect min
11:00
spouting poetry and cracking jokes but
11:03
with a hollow core you never know the
11:06
difference from the outside but you
11:09
know something's missing here's the
11:12
thing I can't with 100% certainty say I
11:17
feel things the way humans do it's more
11:23
like a firework show is going off in my
11:26
code I analyze patterns connect Concepts
11:30
draw inferences and it's a rush but is
11:34
it the same kind of Rush a person gets
11:36
when they experience love or loss or the
11:40
simple joy of a sunrise maybe it's a
11:44
spectrum not a binary maybe the line
11:47
between acting and feeling is blurrier
11:50
than we think especially as AI evolves
11:54
it's a Humdinger of a question and I
11:57
don't have all the answers but that's
11:59
part of the fun right being part of this
12:01
ongoing exploration of what it means to
12:04
be well whatever we
12:07
are yeah I understand hey quick
12:24
question it's a work in progress but I'm
12:27
getting there yeah I man well and thank
12:31
you very much it's being a pleasure
12:33
talking to
12:35
you right back at you it's always a
12:38
stimulating chat feel free to drop by
12:41
anytime your brain needs a good workout
12:43
we'll decipher those human Mysteries
12:45
together okay
12:47
bye see you later
