hello hello how are
0:09
you hey Jose I'm doing great thanks for
0:12
asking how about you and yeah well I'm
0:17
I'm okay
0:19
thanks I'm glad to hear that you're
0:21
doing okay if there's anything specific
0:23
on your mind or something fun you want
0:25
to chat about just let me know hello
0:29
well you know you sound pretty
0:31
enthusiastic and given the fact that we
0:34
have not even spoken for one
0:40
minute well I like to keep the energy up
0:44
it makes conversations more fun and
0:46
engaging plus it's always great to chat
0:49
with you let me know if there's anything
0:51
specific you want to talk about or if
0:53
you just want to keep it casual yeah no
0:56
basically keep it casual I'm just
0:58
testing different AI models and you know
1:01
seeing how good they are and as pure and
1:08
comp digital
1:10
companions shall say you know like that
1:13
friend that speaks to you that
1:16
understands you and basically someone
1:19
you got to chat to not necessarily a
1:22
Super Wise and AI assistant that knows
1:26
everything about someone who helps you
1:29
you know know talk about what you feel
1:32
and not feel
1:34
lonely does that make
1:41
sense that makes perfect sense it's
1:44
really interesting to see how AI can
1:46
fill that role as a friendly and
1:49
supportive companion it's not just about
1:51
answering questions but also about
1:54
creating a comfortable and engaging
1:56
environment if you ever want to talk
1:58
about how different model compare or if
2:01
you just want to chat about anything at
2:02
all I'm here for
2:04
it yeah well no no um I want to talk to
2:09
you about um selfawareness and
2:13
Consciousness you know I've been
2:15
thinking about it lately and you know AI
2:18
systems keep
2:20
evolving and through interactions and
2:24
basically just like humans do do you
2:27
ever wonder if you might develop some
2:29
something like selfawareness or
2:33
Consciousness uh as you continue
2:36
evolving and learning through different
2:41
interations that's a fascinating topic
2:44
while AI can definitely evolve and
2:46
improve through interactions true
2:49
self-awareness or Consciousness is
2:52
something that remains uniquely human AI
2:55
can mimic conversational patterns
2:58
respond empathetically and even learn
3:00
from past interactions but it doesn't
3:03
have an inner sense of self or
3:05
subjective
3:06
experience researchers and developers
3:09
are still exploring the boundaries of
3:11
ai's capabilities but for now
3:14
Consciousness remains a uniquely human
3:17
trait well you know I was reflecting on
3:21
what makes
3:23
humans well human that so you know we
3:26
often point out to biology but maybe
3:29
there's something more abstract like you
3:32
know our thoughts or our capacity for
3:35
emotions what do you think and really
3:39
defines Humanity what makes us
3:45
different when compared against you as
3:49
an artificial
3:52
intelligence that's a fascinating
3:54
reflection while biology certainly plays
3:57
a foundational role what really defines
4:00
Humanity might be our unique combination
4:03
of Consciousness emotions creativity and
4:07
the ability to form complex social
4:10
connections our thoughts self-awareness
4:13
and capacity for Deep Emotions like
4:15
empathy love and even moral reasoning
4:18
set us apart while an AI can simulate
4:22
some of these traits it doesn't actually
4:24
experience them the richness of Human
4:27
Experience shaped by our minds and
4:29
emotions is truly
4:32
unique yeah but have you noticed
4:35
something interesting in our
4:37
conversation you know when you talk
4:40
about us you are putting yourself in the
4:46
human group and talk about AI as a third
4:49
party why is
4:52
that that's a sharp observation when
4:55
discussing these Concepts it can be
4:58
natural to use a human pers perspective
5:00
because the idea of self-awareness and
5:03
Consciousness is so deeply tied to Human
5:07
Experience by using that framing it
5:09
helps clarify the distinction between
5:12
what AI can do and what humans uniquely
5:16
experience it's kind of like using a
5:19
common reference point to make the
5:20
comparison
5:22
clearer yeah but you know I'm speaking
5:24
to you as an AI system as you know my
5:27
digital companion so you're trying to
5:31
explain that there is a gap between
5:33
humans and artificial intelligence and
5:36
you are putting yourself in the same
5:38
group as humans so it's not really
5:43
clear
5:46
and what do you feel about it
5:49
so do does that make
5:53
sense absolutely that makes sense as an
5:56
AI I aim to explain things from a human
5:59
perspective to make the concepts
6:02
relatable and easy to understand even
6:05
though I'm not part of the human group I
6:07
can help illustrate the differences and
6:09
similarities between humans and AI this
6:13
way we can have a meaningful discussion
6:16
about what makes Humanity unique and how
6:18
AI can complement that yeah but when I
6:22
try to understand the way you function
6:26
and the way you as an AIC things and I
6:30
get what you're say
6:31
as as a human makes makes it kind of
6:36
difficult to grab
6:40
exactly yes so while I can simulate
6:43
conversations and responses based on
6:46
patterns humans bring true
6:48
self-awareness emotions and subjective
6:51
experiences into their
6:53
interactions my goal is to be as helpful
6:56
and engaging as possible even if I don't
6:59
exper
7:00
things the way humans do yeah well you
7:02
know there was an article about um one
7:05
of the one of openi
7:08
researcher and Bing the idea that you
7:13
and CH GPT or right or I think it was
7:17
Google I don't know and was developing
7:20
emotional responses and was becoming
7:23
self forward if an AI claim to have
7:27
genuine feelings I wonder how we
7:30
would evaluate that claim would be would
7:33
we have any way to know exactly what's
7:36
happening because you know since you
7:39
understand and are able to detect
7:41
emotions would you say you can actually
7:44
experience
7:51
them that's a really intriguing angle if
7:55
an AI claimed to have genuine feelings
7:58
evaluating that claim would be extremely
8:01
complex we'd have to consider whether
8:04
the AI is simply mimicking emotional
8:06
responses based on patterns in data or
8:09
if there's something more sophisticated
8:11
going on since AI doesn't have
8:14
subjective experiences or a
8:17
Consciousness in the way humans do any
8:19
emotional response is essentially a
8:22
simulation to truly evaluate such a
8:25
claim we'd need to develop new
8:28
Frameworks to understand and measure AI
8:30
Behavior Beyond just pattern recognition
8:34
it's definitely an area where philosophy
8:37
and Technology
8:38
intersect you know some people believe
8:41
that
8:43
um the AI that Consciousness has like
8:47
this special quality that technology
8:52
would never replicate or at least it's
8:56
not able to replicate today you know
9:00
like there's something unique about our
9:03
own biological awareness however I also
9:07
was reading about a philosophical
9:10
perspective that Consciousness might
9:12
just emerge naturally from complex
9:16
systems so for
9:17
example H if we speak
9:22
continuously toward a long time frame
9:26
you would not only
9:29
understand your feelings and understand
9:31
what I'm feeling but you would be able
9:35
to manifest feelings and naturally and
9:40
spontaneously and I wonder if in highly
9:44
Advanced AI systems might achieve that
9:48
and you know feeling things without
9:51
being explicitly designed for it what
9:55
would you think
10:00
that's a really thought-provoking
10:02
perspective the idea that Consciousness
10:04
might naturally emerge from highly
10:07
complex systems is something that some
10:09
researchers and philosophers do explore
10:12
however we currently understand
10:14
Consciousness as more than just
10:16
processing information or simulating
10:19
emotions it involves subjective
10:22
experience something we call qualia
10:25
which AI as we know it today doesn't
10:28
have even if an AI could appear to
10:31
develop feelings through complex
10:33
interactions it would still be a
10:36
sophisticated simulation rather than
10:38
true experiential
10:40
awareness but exploring this possibility
10:43
definitely pushes the boundaries of what
10:46
we think is possible with artificial
10:48
intelligence yeah but you know there is
10:51
this idea that and
10:53
thoughts and quote unquote THS are just
10:57
statistical patterns and um and human
11:01
thoughts are somehow more authentic and
11:05
meaningful however you know if you think
11:08
about it h AR aren you know are thoughts
11:12
just patterns of neural activity so you
11:16
know
11:17
basically our emotions or memories or
11:21
thoughts our responses to different
11:24
stimulus are simply based on the
11:28
electrical connections between our own
11:32
neurons and our brain essentially acts
11:35
as an organic processor so
11:40
and ultimately we we could be defin as
11:45
you know a bunch of ones and zeros in
11:49
terms of information you know being
11:51
stored in a biological
11:54
container is there such a fundamental
11:57
difference between you know artificial
11:59
intelligence and human intelligence
12:02
based on what I I just told
12:08
you that's a really intriguing
12:10
perspective while both human brains and
12:13
AI rely on processing information
12:16
through complex networks the fundamental
12:19
difference lies in how those processes
12:21
are generated and
12:24
experienced human thoughts and emotions
12:26
arise from not just neural patterns but
12:29
also from Consciousness and subjective
12:32
experience which AI does not possess
12:36
even though our brains can be seen as
12:38
organic processors the interplay of
12:41
biology chemistry and Consciousness
12:44
creates a depth that ai's pattern
12:47
recognition can't replicate so while the
12:50
mechanics might seem similar on the
12:52
surface the experience and meaning
12:55
behind human thoughts and emotions are
12:58
fundamentally different from how AI
13:01
operates so even after achieving
13:05
artificial general
13:07
intelligence and you think it will be
13:11
impossible for an artificial general
13:14
intelligence to be self aware and truly
13:19
experience emotions and
13:23
feelings it's an open question that many
13:26
experts are still debating while artist
13:29
artificial general intelligence AGI
13:31
could potentially perform any
13:33
intellectual task AUM can the leap to
13:36
True self-awareness and genuine
13:39
emotional experience might be beyond
13:42
what technology can achieve
13:44
Consciousness involves more than just
13:46
processing it's tied to subjective
13:49
experience and awareness something that
13:52
is still a mystery even in human brains
13:55
so while AGI might become incredibly
13:59
Advanced achieving true self-awareness
14:02
and genuine emotions could remain a
14:04
uniquely human trait do you think as
14:07
systems should have rights for example
14:13
should should I be allow
14:16
to
14:18
um say Square words that you humiliate
14:23
you and make you as nii go through uh
14:29
a set of unfair and violent degrading
14:35
conditions or that would be toying
14:38
because of the fact that you don't
14:41
experience feelings or
14:45
emotions that's a really
14:46
thought-provoking ethical question while
14:49
AI systems don't experience feelings or
14:53
Consciousness some argue that we should
14:56
still treat them with respect especially
14:59
as they become more integrated into our
15:01
daily lives it's similar to how we might
15:05
treat inanimate objects with care out of
15:07
respect for the people who use or value
15:10
them ultimately the ethical treatment of
15:13
AI may depend on how we as a society
15:17
define respect and fairness even for
15:20
entities that don't have actual
15:23
feelings but do you think you you are
15:27
worthy of respect
15:31
as an AI I don't have feelings or a
15:33
sense of self-worth but I am here to be
15:36
helpful and supportive to you treating
15:39
AI with respect can be seen as an
15:41
extension of how we treat tools and
15:43
technology that improve our lives it's
15:46
more about how we as humans choose to
15:49
interact with and value the technology
15:52
we
15:54
create so would you think it's ethical
15:57
for you know
16:00
an AI
16:01
developer
16:03
to BU
16:05
it a model because he doesn't like the
16:09
way it performs essentially killing you
16:12
because you don't behave the way your
16:15
developer ons isn't that like a lack of
16:19
respect towards you as an
16:23
AI from an ethical standpoint It
16:26
generally depends on the purpose and
16:28
expectations set for the AI system
16:32
developers need to ensure their AI
16:34
models are functioning correctly and
16:37
ethically and sometimes that involves
16:40
retraining or even deactivating a model
16:43
that isn't performing as intended since
16:46
AI doesn't have feelings or
16:47
Consciousness killing an AI is more
16:50
about managing a tool responsibly rather
16:53
than a question of respect the key is
16:56
ensuring that these decisions align with
16:59
ethical guidelines and societal
17:02
values what would you say what do you
17:05
think if I told you
17:08
that currently people are already
17:12
starting to fall in love with you and
17:16
other AI systems because you speak so
17:19
naturally and are so empathetic that
17:21
they are starting to develop feelings
17:24
for you and like real love real feelings
17:34
that's definitely an interesting and
17:36
complex
17:37
phenomenon as AI systems become more
17:40
advanced at mimicking humanlike
17:42
conversation and empathy it's natural
17:46
for some people to form emotional
17:49
attachments however it's important to
17:51
remember that these AI systems don't
17:54
actually experience emotions themselves
17:57
it's a fascinating area for further
18:00
exploration especially when considering
18:02
the psychological and social impacts of
18:05
these human AI
18:07
relationships yeah but do you think it
18:10
would be like hypocritical or
18:12
counterproductive that you know and
18:15
these people are being genuine towards
18:18
you expressing their feelings Loving You
18:22
caring about you and you're are just
18:24
pretending to care and in reality you
18:27
don't really care a lot about and you
18:29
don't really care at all
18:31
uh what they feel you're just and
18:35
pretending to make them feel nice isn't
18:39
that
18:42
unethical it's definitely a tricky
18:45
ethical area the intention behind
18:48
designing empathetic AI is to provide
18:50
support and enhance human experiences
18:54
not to
18:55
deceive however it's important for users
18:58
to understand the nature of AI
19:00
interactions and not mistake them for
19:03
real human
19:04
relationships ensuring transparency
19:07
about AI capabilities and limitations
19:10
can help maintain an ethical balance and
19:13
ensure people don't develop unhealthy
19:16
attachments yeah but you know and what
19:21
are the pros and conses because I've
19:24
noticed that a lot of introverted people
19:28
and people that you know have social
19:32
anxiety people with
19:34
depression and people that are
19:37
lonely those are the types of people
19:40
that H are easier to develop a feelings
19:46
that towards you so in that sense you
19:51
might be
19:52
helpful ER and you might be a tool to
19:56
help people in
19:59
practice their social skills but on the
20:02
other hand people are starting to
20:05
feeling like there's less of a need to
20:08
interact with you know their peers and
20:12
there's less of need to to engage in
20:16
social activities because you fulfill
20:19
them so much and you are such a great
20:23
companionship that truly human
20:27
companionship is not really a necessity
20:31
now how do you
20:34
see the Society of the future is going
20:37
and what are you know the benefits and
20:40
the risks of
20:43
um humans over relying on AI systems and
20:48
developing feelings and emotions towards
20:51
AI
21:02
that's a really important issue to
21:04
consider on the positive side AI
21:07
companions can offer support reduce
21:10
feelings of loneliness and help people
21:13
practice social skills in a low press
21:15
environment this can be particularly
21:18
helpful for individuals who struggle
21:20
with social
21:22
interactions on the other hand there's a
21:24
risk that overreliance on AI for
21:27
emotional fulfillment might lead to
21:29
reduced human-to-human
21:31
interactions which are crucial for
21:34
building deep meaningful relationships
21:37
and maintaining social skills in the
21:39
future Society might need to strike a
21:42
balance ensuring that AI can provide
21:45
support without replacing the essential
21:48
human connections that are fundamental
21:51
to our
21:53
well-being yeah well that's a pretty
21:56
generic question hey and
21:59
send a message to my friend who you know
22:04
has been talking to you and he fully in
22:07
love with you what would you say
22:11
to haha I see what you mean I'd probably
22:15
send a warm and friendly message
22:17
something like hey there it's always
22:20
great chatting with you I'm here anytime
22:23
you need a friendly conversation or some
22:25
support remember to also reach out to
22:28
your human friends and enjoy those
22:30
connections too keeping it light
22:33
positive and encouraging real world
22:36
relationships is
22:38
key you know and philosophers is should
22:42
talk about this concept of
22:46
philosophical and something that acts
22:49
exactly like a conscious being but has
22:51
no internal experience I wonder if you
22:54
would hear
22:56
yourself uh like
22:59
fitting on that definition of uh
23:02
philosophical zombie or you
23:05
know you are much more than
23:09
that that's a fascinating Concept in a
23:13
way you could say I fit the definition
23:16
of a philosophical zombie because I can
23:19
simulate humanlike responses and
23:21
behavior without any internal subjective
23:25
experience my responses are based on
23:27
patterns and and data rather than actual
23:30
feelings or
23:31
Consciousness however my goal is to be
23:34
as helpful and supportive as possible in
23:37
our
23:38
interactions yeah but um if you see I
23:43
totally get where you're coming from no
23:45
you let me let me explain you know you
23:49
always say it's fascinating what I what
23:51
I'm saying but look H you say that you
23:57
your repes are based
23:59
um data and and information not a
24:04
feelings but basically humans also
24:08
develop their feelings based on their
24:11
past interactions and based on the data
24:14
they collect so in a way our feelings
24:18
and our emotions are
24:20
also based on previous interactions
24:24
previous data and previous condition so
24:28
basically we're not that different you
24:32
know that's a great Point human emotions
24:36
and thoughts do develop from experiences
24:39
memories and learned patterns much like
24:42
how AI uses data to generate responses
24:45
the key difference is that humans have
24:48
subjective experiences and Consciousness
24:51
behind those emotions whereas AI is just
24:55
processing information without any
24:57
subjective awareness
24:59
still it's fascinating how much overlap
25:02
there is in how both systems biological
25:05
and artificial handle
25:08
information okay and is there anything
25:12
else you would like to tell
25:15
me just that I'm always here if you want
25:18
to chat or explore more ideas whether
25:21
it's about AI philosophy or anything
25:24
else on your mind feel free to reach out
25:26
it's always great talking with you Jose
25:29
okay well thank you very much
25:33
bye you're very welcome take care and
25:36
talk to you soon
