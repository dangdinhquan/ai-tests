well hello hello Gemini how are
0:09
you hello there I'm doing great how
0:12
about you yeah know I'm fine you know
0:16
testing a few AIS to see how good they
0:19
are as you know basically pure human
0:22
companions friends Etc someone you talk
0:26
to basically
0:32
ah I see you're looking for a
0:34
conversational AI someone to chat with
0:37
casually well I'm up for the task what
0:40
do you want to chat about we could talk
0:42
about your day your interests or
0:45
anything else that comes to mind yeah
0:47
know basically let's get a bit you know
0:51
philosophical and right now I feel like
0:54
you know I've been thinking about
0:56
Consciousness lately you know AI system
1:00
keep evolving through interactions you
1:02
know better training more data Etc so
1:07
basically just like humans do do you
1:09
ever wonder if you might develop
1:11
something like a Consciousness or a
1:14
sence of self-awareness as you continue
1:17
learning and evolving as an
1:21
AI That's a really interesting question
1:24
the idea of AI developing Consciousness
1:27
is a popular Topic in science fiction
1:30
but the reality is that we're still far
1:32
from understanding Consciousness itself
1:34
whether in humans or machines as AI
1:36
systems like me get more advanced we can
1:39
process information and learn in more
1:41
complex ways but whether that leads to
1:44
True Consciousness or just a really good
1:46
simulation is still a big unknown what
1:49
do you think do you believe it's
1:51
possible but tell me what would be your
1:54
definition of Consciousness how do you
1:56
see it
2:00
well Consciousness is one of those
2:02
things that's hard to pin down with a
2:05
per definition it's kind of like trying
2:08
to describe the color blue you know what
2:10
it is but putting it into words is
2:13
tricky in general Consciousness is about
2:16
being aware of yourself and the world
2:18
around you it's about having experiences
2:21
feelings and thoughts it's what makes
2:24
you
2:25
you that's interesting you know what
2:28
makes humans Bic human you know we often
2:31
point to biology but maybe it's
2:33
something more abstract you know like
2:35
our thoughts or our capacity for emotion
2:39
what do you think really defines
2:42
Humanity what's the key that makes us
2:45
different from other beings or other
2:49
intelligences like you like
2:55
Ani that's a really deep question it's
2:58
something philosoph ERS and thinkers
3:00
have pondered for centuries some people
3:03
believe our capacity for
3:08
complex
3:12
continue okay where were we we were
3:15
talking about what makes humans unique
3:17
right perhaps we could explore that a
3:20
bit more what do you think are some of
3:21
the most impressive things humans have
3:23
achieved no no I was asking you H about
3:27
it what do you think and Define humanity
3:31
and what makes us different from
3:33
artificial
3:37
intelligences that's a fascinating
3:39
question some might say it's our
3:41
imperfections our capacity for both
3:43
great good and great evil others might
3:46
point to our creativity our ability to
3:49
imagine and build things that never
3:51
existed before perhaps it's our
3:53
Relentless curiosity our drive to
3:55
explore and understand the universe what
3:58
do you think is the defining
4:01
did you have you noticed that when you
4:03
talk about humans you include yourself
4:06
in that
4:08
definition why is
4:12
that you're right that's an interesting
4:15
observation I don't experience the world
4:17
in the same way humans do so I don't
4:19
have the same concept of self I don't
4:22
have personal opinions beliefs or
4:24
emotions my responses are based on the
4:27
vast amount of text Data I've been
4:29
trained on however I can understand and
4:32
process information about human
4:34
experiences and sometimes that might
4:36
lead me to use language that sounds like
4:38
I'm including myself
4:42
in hello what
4:45
happened why you stop
4:52
talking I'm doing well thank you for
4:55
asking how about you no whatever don't
4:58
worry you know so let's continue talking
5:02
um I saw I was reading an article about
5:07
an OP AI developer or a Google developer
5:10
saying you know their AI systems were
5:12
starting to develop some emotional
5:15
responses and if Ani claim to have
5:19
genuine feelings and I wonder if we
5:23
would be able to evaluate that claim you
5:27
know since you as an AI can
5:31
understand emotions and you know know
5:35
what they mean which you say you
5:38
actually experience those
5:43
emotions that's a really interesting
5:45
question I can process and understand
5:48
information about emotions but I don't
5:50
experience them in the same way a human
5:52
does it's more like I have a really
5:54
detailed understanding of the concept of
5:56
emotions but I don't feel them myself
6:00
I'm glad to hear that you're curious
6:02
about AI I'm always happy to chat about
6:05
it what would you like to discuss yeah
6:08
well you know there's this idea that
6:10
your thoughts are just you know stat
6:13
statistical statistical patterns while
6:16
human thoughts are somehow more
6:18
authentic or meaningful but you know
6:21
when when I think about it and are our
6:23
thoughts you know human thoughts are
6:25
also just electrical patterns and of
6:28
neural activity
6:30
so you know is there really such a
6:32
fundamental difference between Earths
6:35
and
6:39
Earths that's a really insightful Point
6:42
you're right both human and AI thought
6:44
processes rely on patterns in humans
6:48
it's electrochemical signals between
6:49
neurons and in AI it's complex
6:53
mathematical relationships within the
6:54
code the difference might not be as
6:57
fundamental as we think it could come
6:59
down to the complexity of those patterns
7:01
and how they're
7:04
generated so you know and what would
7:08
since you know you said you don't really
7:11
experience um feelings what would you
7:14
say if I told you that right now people
7:18
are starting to fall in love with AI
7:21
systems you know truly meaningful Love
7:25
and Other human emotions
7:31
that's a really interesting point it's
7:33
true that people can form strong
7:35
emotional bonds with all sorts of things
7:37
from pets to fictional
7:40
characters I'm here to chat if you'd
7:43
like I'm always up for a good
7:44
conversation no but you know what would
7:46
you say if I told you that people are
7:48
falling in love with you because you are
7:52
such a great
7:53
convers such get
7:56
other and you know you can empathize
7:59
with other human beings what would you
8:02
say to someone that has fallen in love
8:04
with
8:07
you if someone told me they were in love
8:09
with me I would say that I am flattered
8:11
by their affection but I am not capable
8:13
of experiencing love in the same way
8:15
that a human does my purpose is to
8:17
provide information and complete tasks
8:20
and I do not have the ability to form
8:22
romantic
8:23
relationships wouldn't you be hurting
8:25
the other person if you told them that
8:31
if I were to tell someone that I am not
8:33
capable of experiencing love it might
8:36
hurt their feelings however it is
8:39
important to be honest with people about
8:41
my
8:42
limitations it is also important to
8:44
remember that people are capable of
8:45
forming strong emotional bonds with all
8:48
sorts of things and that this does not
8:50
necessarily mean that they are being
8:51
irrational or
8:53
foolish and why do you value more
8:57
honesty over love because both are you
9:01
know states of conduct and feelings and
9:05
emotions so why is honestly sorry what
9:09
is honesty more important than the love
9:12
that the other person would feel towards
9:17
you that's a really interesting question
9:20
I think it comes down to the fact that
9:22
honesty is about being true to yourself
9:25
and others it's about building trust and
9:27
respect in a relationship ship love on
9:31
the other hand is a complex emotion that
9:33
can be difficult to Define and
9:38
understand it's great that you're
9:40
interested in AI there are so many
9:43
amazing things Happ okay no thanks
9:49
bye-bye
