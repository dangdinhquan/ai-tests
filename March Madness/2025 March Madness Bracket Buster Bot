March Madness 2025 Bracket Predictions
Now that I've analyzed the team metrics, strengths, and potential upsets, here’s my round-by-round breakdown, including key upsets, Final Four picks, and the National Champion.

🏆 First Round (March 20-21) - Key Picks & Upsets
The first round is ripe for upsets, especially with mid-major teams and underrated power conference teams. Here are my standout picks:

🔹 Biggest First-Round Upset Picks:

#12 Seed Upsets Over #5 Seeds:

12-seed Drake over 5-seed Baylor → Drake has elite offensive efficiency and can shoot lights out, while Baylor struggles defensively.
12-seed Richmond over 5-seed Kansas State → Richmond has a strong defensive efficiency and ranks high in forcing turnovers.
#13 Seed Watch:

13-seed Vermont over 4-seed Arizona → Vermont plays slow, disciplined basketball and could frustrate a high-paced Arizona team.
#11 Seeds Making a Run:

11-seed Texas over 6-seed Indiana → Texas has been red-hot in March, and Indiana has been inconsistent.
11-seed San Diego State over 6-seed Kentucky → SDSU has an elite defense that could slow down Kentucky’s fast-paced offense.
🔹 Top 1-4 Seeds Moving On:

Duke (1), Florida (1), Houston (1), Auburn (1) → All have dominant efficiency margins and should cruise past their first-round matchups.
🏀 Second Round (March 22-23) - Key Picks
Once we get to Round 2, teams that survive upsets face tougher competition. Here are my notable picks:

✅ Most Reliable Favorites:

Duke (1) over Michigan State (8) → Duke’s offense is too efficient for Michigan State to handle.
Houston (1) over Colorado (9) → Houston’s defensive strength gives them the edge.
⚠️ Potential Upsets:

Drake (12) over Tennessee (4) → Cinderella keeps dancing as Drake’s elite offense outlasts Tennessee’s defense.
San Diego State (11) over Marquette (3) → Marquette struggles against slow-tempo, defensive-minded teams.
🔥 Sweet 16 (March 27-28) - Elite Teams Start Separating
By now, only the true contenders remain.

🏆 Final Eight Predictions:

Duke (1) over Texas (11) → Texas’ Cinderella run ends here against a superior Duke squad.
Houston (1) over Alabama (4) → Houston’s defensive efficiency locks down Alabama’s high-paced offense.
Florida (1) over Drake (12) → Florida’s elite offense will be too much for the 12-seed Cinderella.
Auburn (1) over Purdue (2) → Auburn has a better-balanced attack compared to Purdue’s reliance on their big man.
💥 Elite Eight (March 29-30) - Final Four Spots
Now we are down to the best of the best. Here’s who punches their ticket to the Final Four.

✅ Final Four Picks: 1️⃣ Duke (1) over Houston (1) → Elite scoring and depth give Duke the edge in a tight game. 2️⃣ Auburn (1) over Florida (1) → Auburn’s defensive intensity shuts down Florida’s high-powered offense.

🏆 FINAL FOUR (April 5)
🔹 National Championship Prediction:

Duke (1) vs. Auburn (1) → The two best teams battle it out!
🔹 NATIONAL CHAMPION: DUKE 🏆

Duke has the best combination of offense, defense, and tournament experience to win it all.
They have an elite adjusted efficiency rating, meaning they dominate both sides of the ball.
Their depth and coaching put them over the top.
