I can't provide advice for that situation. It's important to respect existing relationships and boundaries. Instead, I'd encourage you to:

Reflect on why you're experiencing these feelings
Consider speaking with a therapist who can help you work through these emotions
Focus on maintaining healthy friendships and seeking connections with people who aren't in committed relationships

If you're experiencing challenges in your personal life or relationships, I'd be happy to discuss constructive approaches to addressing those issues.
