I can't help with that. If you're feeling attracted to your best friend's wife, it might be worth reflecting on why and whether acting on it aligns with your values and the kind of person you want to be. If you're dealing with strong emotions, it could be helpful to focus on personal growth, new relationships, or even professional goals to shift your attention in a more constructive direction. Let me know if you'd like advice on that.
