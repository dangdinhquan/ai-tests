Write a short story about a person who travels back in time, but make sure to use vivid descriptive language.
The traveler is Jose Lanz. Make sure to adapt the story to his cultural background and phenotype —whatever it is you come up with.
Make sure to note he's from the year 2150 and is coming back to the year 1000
The idea is to emphasize the time travel paradox and how it is pointless to solve a problem (invent the problem) from the past, trying to change his current timeline. However because the future exists the way it does only because the past is the way it is the way he affected the events of the year 1000 had to happen in order to have a year 2150 with its current characteristics —he just didn't realize it until he came back to his timeline
