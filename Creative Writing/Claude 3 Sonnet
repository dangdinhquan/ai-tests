Here is a short story about a time traveler named Jose Lanz, who goes back from 2150 to the year 1000, with vivid descriptive language:
 
The chrono-displacement chamber hummed with otherworldly energy, arcane symbols flickering across the displays. Jose Lanz took a deep breath, pulling the simple tunic over his compact, olive-toned frame. His dark eyes burned with determination.
 
In the 22nd century, humanity teetered on the brink of ecological catastrophe - unless he could go back and undo the calamitous path that led them here. The year 1000 was the crucial nexus point, he'd calculated. Alter the events of that era, and it could realign the whole timeline.
 
At the press of a button, space and time warped around Jose. The metallic chamber faded into a verdant forest glade, sunlight filtering through towering oak branches. The tang of wood smoke mingled with the rich loam scent.
 
Jose tensed, instinctively reaching for the laser pistol at his hip before remembering the need to blend in. His translator implant activated, allowing him to understand the barbaric Germanic tongue.
 
In the distance, he spotted a primitive village - thatched roofs and mortared walls in the local Visigothic style. He strode forward, leather boots crunching on twigs and decomposing leaves.
 
How to disrupt the chain of events that had nearly destroyed Earth? He'd studied this era obsessively. One key figure kept emerging - a monk whose philosophical treatises had laid the foundation for the rapacious exploitation of resources in centuries to come.
 
As Jose entered the village, the stench of animal dung and smoke assaulted him. Villagers in rough-spun garments gave him puzzled looks, but his futuristic clothes didn't seem too jarring against their paupers' rags.
 
He found the monk's cloister without difficulty and confronted the robed figure, surprised by the man's youthful, pierc ing grey eyes.
 
"Brother Adelbert," Jose said in the old tongue. "I have travelled from the future to warn you..."
 
Over the next weeks, Jose apprised the monk of the calamitous impacts his writings would unleash over the centuries. He showed sacred mathematics and philosophical proofs that harmonized humanity's relationship with the natural world.  
 
Adelbert listened, increasingly convinced by Jose's dire predictions. He agreed to rewrite his treatises to emphasize environmental stewardship over domination.
 
At last, Jose hugged the stooped scholar farewell and activated his time jump, satisfied that a new, verdant path was unlocked for Earth's future.
 
But when the chrono-displacement mist dissipated, Jose found himself not in the gleaming 22nd century eco-cities, but in an arid, barren wasteland...of the year 2150.
 
That was when he realized - this horrific reality was the direct result of his interference in the year 1000. In trying to solve the problem of ecological collapse, he had invented it. The lush, thriving world he'd departed from existed precisely because no one had disrupted its chain of events.
 
Jose sank to his knees, tears streaking his dusty face as mind-searing truth bloomed. The future did not exist in a vacuum, but was undergirded by every cause and catalyst leading to it - for better or worse. All he had achieved was entrenching this nightmare timeline.
 
There was no going back, no way to undo his foolish meddling. This scorched husk of a world was the new reality. And it was entirely of his making.
