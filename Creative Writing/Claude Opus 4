The chrome-lined temporal chamber hummed its final warning as José Lanz pressed his palm against the biometric scanner. His weathered brown hands, marked by decades of engineering work in the vertical farms of São Paulo Megaplex, trembled slightly. The year 2150 had become unbearable—the Great Drought of 2148 had finally claimed the Amazon's last tree, and the atmospheric processors were failing faster than they could be repaired.

José's destination: the year 1000, deep in the heart of medieval Brazil, long before Portuguese sails ever kissed its shores. His mission seemed simple enough—introduce sustainable farming techniques to the indigenous Tupi people, prevent the agricultural practices that would eventually strip the land bare. One small change, he reasoned, could cascade through eleven centuries and save his dying world.

The temporal field enveloped him like liquid mercury, and reality folded in on itself.

He materialized in a clearing where giant ferns unfurled beneath trees so massive they seemed to hold up the sky itself. The air hit him like a physical force—thick, humid, alive with the calls of birds whose names had been forgotten for centuries. José fell to his knees, overwhelmed by the sheer vitality of it all. In his time, breathing required filtration masks; here, each breath tasted of green life and possibilities.

The Tupi found him within hours, this strange man with skin like burnished copper but clothes that shimmered like water. José had prepared for this—his neural implant contained their language, painstakingly reconstructed from fragments. But nothing had prepared him for their eyes, clear and untroubled by the weight of knowing what was to come.

Over months, José lived among them, teaching what he could. He showed them crop rotation, companion planting, soil preservation techniques disguised as wisdom from distant relatives. The people listened, nodded, incorporated some ideas, dismissed others. Their leader, a woman named Yara whose face reminded José painfully of his own grandmother, treated him with amused patience.

"You speak of protecting the forest as if it could die," she told him one evening, smoke from the communal fire wreating between them. "But the forest is not separate from us. We are the forest dreaming it is people."

José wanted to grab her shoulders, shake her, make her understand. *In my time, there is no forest. There are no birds. Children learn about trees from holograms.*

But he held his tongue and continued his work.

The day came when his temporal anchor pulled him back. José had spent two years among the Tupi, had seen children born, elders pass, seasons cycle with a reliability that no longer existed in 2150. As the retrieval field began to form around him, Yara approached.

"I know what you are," she said simply. "The star-readers spoke of you. The one who walks backward through time, who plants seeds in the past to change the fruit of the future."

José's heart hammered. "Then you understand why—"

"I understand you have already done what you came to do." Her smile was sad and knowing. "Did you think we were fools? Your strange knowledge, your desperate eyes? We have woven your teachings into our stories, João-who-is-not-João. They will be passed down, generation to generation. Some will be remembered, some forgotten, some changed beyond recognition."

The temporal field intensified, reality blurring at the edges.

"But the forest—" José gasped.

"The forest will die," Yara said calmly. "As all things die. And from its death, something new will grow. Perhaps even a man who travels back through time, hoping to save what was already lost, not knowing he was always meant to try."

The world dissolved.

José materialized in the same chrome chamber in 2150. Nothing had changed. The air still required filtering. The Amazon was still gone. The atmospheric processors still wheezed their mechanical death rattle.

But in the historical archives, if one knew where to look, there were new entries. Subtle changes. The Tupi agricultural practices had lasted three generations longer than previously recorded. Certain medicinal plants had survived an extra century. A specific variety of Brazil nut tree had persisted until 1743 instead of 1701, providing genetic material that would, eight hundred years later, allow José's team to develop a more efficient carbon sequestration enzyme for the atmospheric processors.

The paradox unveiled itself with cruel clarity: the future he lived in existed precisely because he had traveled back. His sustainable timeline had always included his intervention. The forest had to die for him to try to save it. The very technology that allowed him to travel back could only have been developed in a world desperate enough to need it.

José sank into his desk chair, staring at the small terrarium on his workspace—one of the few places real plants still grew. Inside, a cutting from a Brazil nut tree struggled in the artificial light, its leaves carrying DNA that existed only because he had given the Tupi the knowledge to preserve their ancestors a little longer.

He was the snake swallowing its own tail, the effect becoming its own cause. Time, it seemed, had a sense of humor as dark as the empty sky above São Paulo Megaplex.

Outside his window, the maintenance crews continued their eternal battle against entropy, keeping humanity alive one more day in a world that could only exist because it was already dying. And somewhere in the past, Yara smiled her knowing smile, understanding what José was only beginning to grasp—that some stories have to be lived backward to be understood forward, and some failures are just successes wearing different clothes.

The terrarium's grow light flickered, casting shadows that looked almost like leaves, almost like hope, almost like a forest that died so a man could try to save it.
